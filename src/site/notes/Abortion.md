Hello! Thanks for caring enough to read this far. If you were sent this, chances are you are 1) a Christian, and 2) Pro-Choice. I'm not trying to appeal to human sensibilities or even to convince you to change your position at all. I simply want to dryly and clearly articulate the sole biblical position on this issue. Thank you!

## **1.  Premise: Infallibility of Scripture**
 
- To affirm the infallibility of Scripture means affirming that:
    - All Scripture is _God-breathed_ (2 Timothy 3:16).
    - God cannot lie or err (Numbers 23:19, Titus 1:2).
    - Therefore, Scripture teaches perfect truth in all that it affirms, including moral truth.

If the Bible is infallible, no human reasoning, cultural consensus, or legal right can override its moral authority.

## **2. Premise: Scripture Defines Human Life as Sacred from Conception**

### **A. Psalm 139:13-16: The Unborn as Personally Known and Formed by God**

> **“For You formed my inward parts;  
> You knitted me together in my mother’s womb.  
> I praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.  
> Wonderful are Your works; my soul knows it very well.  
> My frame was not hidden from You,  
> when I was being made in secret,  
> intricately woven in the depths of the earth.  
> Your eyes saw my unformed substance;  
> in Your book were written, every one of them,  
> the days that were formed for me,  
> when as yet there was none of them.”**  
> _(Psalm 139:13–16, ESV)_

- The psalmist uses intensely _personal_ language (“me,” “my,” “I”) while describing his **embryonic state** (“unformed substance”: Hebrew _golem_).
- God is not merely aware of a biological process; He is _personally_ involved as Creator and Sovereign.
- The unborn child’s identity (“my inward parts… my unformed substance”) is already that of the _person David_, not an impersonal mass of cells.
- The phrase _“Your eyes saw my unformed substance”_ indicates divine recognition and relationship—a distinctly personal reality.

Thus, **the unborn is a “me,” not an “it.”** God’s creative knowledge and intentional design confer personhood _from the earliest moment of existence._

### B. **Jeremiah 1:5: Divine Consecration Before Birth**

> **“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,  
> and before you were born I consecrated you;  
> I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”**  
> _(Jeremiah 1:5, ESV)_

- God claims personal knowledge (_“I knew you”_) **before formation**, showing that identity and personhood precede physical birth.
- _“Knew”_ (_yada‘_ in Hebrew) implies intimate, covenantal relationship, the same word used of God’s relationship with His people, not an abstract awareness.
- God _consecrates_ Jeremiah in utero, which is a moral and spiritual action that presupposes personhood. One cannot consecrate a non-person.
- This affirms that divine purpose and personal identity exist **from conception** (and even before in God’s foreknowledge).

### **C. Luke 1:41–44: The Unborn John the Baptist Responds Spiritually**

> **“And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb.  
> And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,  
> and she exclaimed with a loud cry,  
> ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!  
> And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  
> For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears,  
> the baby in my womb leaped for joy.’”**  
> _(Luke 1:41–44, ESV)_

- The word translated _“baby”_ is **βρέφος (_brephos_)**, the same Greek term used for **born infants** (cf. Luke 2:12, “You will find a _baby_ wrapped in swaddling cloths”).
- The unborn John the Baptist is described as **“leaping for joy”**, which is an act of conscious, emotional response attributed to a person, not a mere fetus.
- This occurs in response to the presence of the **unborn Christ**, likewise called “my Lord”, meaning the Messiah is recognized as _Lord_ even before birth.
- The unborn are depicted here as capable of **spiritual perception and recognition**, which only persons can experience.

Both the unborn John and the unborn Jesus are identified as _persons_, one as the prophet, the other as the Lord, while still in the womb. This passage refutes the idea that personhood begins only at birth.

### **D. Exodus 21:22–23 — Legal Protection and Value of the Unborn Life**

> **“When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman’s husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.  
> But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life.”**  
> _(Exodus 21:22–23, ESV)_

**Analysis:**
- The Hebrew phrase _“so that her children come out”_ (_yatsa yeledim_) literally means “the child comes forth.”
- The text distinguishes two cases:
    - **No harm** — the child is born prematurely but survives; the offender pays a fine.
    - **Harm occurs** — if either the mother or child dies, the penalty is _life for life._
- Thus, the unborn child’s life is placed **under the same moral and legal protection** as any other human being.

The Mosaic Law does not view the unborn as property but as a _life_ equal in worth before God. The “lex talionis” (“life for life”) principle applies equally, proving that **the unborn child bears full human personhood.**

### **E. Synthesis**

From these texts, we can construct the following doctrine of **prenatal personhood**:
1. **Divine Formation:** God Himself creates and fashions each unborn life personally (Psalm 139).
2. **Divine Knowledge:** God knows and relates to the unborn personally (Jeremiah 1:5).
3. **Divine Recognition:** The unborn are described with personal terms and can even respond to God (Luke 1:41–44).
4. **Divine Protection:** The Law recognizes the unborn as possessing full moral worth and legal rights (Exodus 21:22–23).

### **F. Summary**

> Scripture defines the fetus not as tissue awaiting personhood but as a person awaiting birth, but a living being known, loved, and purposed by God.  
> Therefore, the intentional destruction of that life is not morally neutral; it is the destruction of a human person created in the image of God.

## **3. Premise: Scripture categorically forbids the intentional taking of innocent human life**

- The sixth commandment “You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13) prohibits unjust killing.
- Proverbs 6:16–17 calls “hands that shed innocent blood” an abomination to the Lord.
- Human life is sacred precisely because humanity is created _imago Dei_, in the image of God (Genesis 1:27; 9:6).

Abortion intentionally ends the life of an innocent human being; therefore, it meets the biblical definition of _murder._

---

## **4. Premise: Pro-choice ethics requires moral relativism**

- The “pro-choice” position rests on the claim that the mother’s _autonomy_ or _choice_ can morally justify ending the life of the unborn.
- This assumes that moral authority lies in the human will, not in divine revelation.
- Yet if Scripture is infallible, the human will cannot define or override what God calls good or evil (Isaiah 5:20, Romans 9:20–21).

Therefore, the pro-choice framework presupposes the fallibility of Scripture, that it can be overruled by personal judgment or cultural ethics.

---

## **5. Logical Conclusion**

- If Scripture is infallible, it is the final moral authority. Scripture affirms that unborn life is sacred and its destruction is morally evil. The pro-choice position affirms that unborn life may be destroyed under certain conditions. Therefore, **to be pro-choice is to deny the authority and moral truth of Scripture**, and thus to deny its infallibility.

- **To claim to believe in the infallibility of Scripture but support abortion is internally inconsistent.** It is equivalent to saying, “I believe the Bible is true, but I reserve the right to decide when it is not binding.” That is, in practice, _functional infallibility of the self_, not of Scripture. A form of idolatry (Genesis 3:5).
