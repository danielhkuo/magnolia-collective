Utilize this as a cheat sheet. Its not meant to discuss anything deep, just to represent common arguments and talking points. There is a lot of jargon, and I would move along to "[[Soteriology/3. The Arguments\|3. The Arguments]]" if this is your first time here.
# **Part 1: The Doctrinal Core — Explicit Soteriological Treatises**

*(These are the foundational texts where the mechanics and theology of salvation are spelled out in didactic, propositional terms. All theological systems consider these central, though their interpretations diverge significantly.)*

*   **A. The Book of Romans**
    *   **Universal Sin and the Need for Salvation:**
        *   **Romans 1:18-3:20:** A systematic argument that both Gentiles (on the basis of natural revelation) and Jews (on the basis of the Law) are under the power of sin.
        *   **Romans 3:10-12, 23:** The climactic summaries: "None is righteous, no, not one... for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
        *   **Theological Comments:** This is universally accepted as the starting point for soteriology. **Semi-Pelagians** would agree on the universality of sin but argue that a spark of human will remains capable of seeking God. **All other orthodox traditions** (Calvinist, Arminian, Lutheran, Catholic, Orthodox) affirm that sin has rendered humanity incapable of saving itself without divine intervention.

    *   **Justification by Faith:**
        *   **Romans 3:21-26:** The thesis statement of the Gospel. Introduces "righteousness of God," "redemption," "propitiation" (or *hilasterion*), and justification as a gift received through faith.
        *   **Romans 4:1-5:** Uses Abraham as the prime example of one who was justified by faith, not works (citing Gen. 15:6).
        *   **Romans 5:1-2, 8-9:** The results of justification: peace with God, and salvation from wrath through Christ's blood, demonstrated by His love.
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Lutherans & Calvinists:** This is the heart of the Gospel. Justification is a *forensic declaration*—God declares a sinner righteous based on Christ's imputed righteousness. It is received by faith *alone* (*sola fide*).
            *   **Arminians/Wesleyans:** Agree with the forensic declaration by faith but emphasize that this faith is enabled by prevenient grace and must be a living, active faith.
            *   **Roman Catholics:** View justification not merely as a legal declaration but as an *infusion* of grace that begins at baptism, making the person truly righteous. It is a process that requires faith, cooperation with grace, and participation in the sacraments. They see "faith" here as the initial act of a longer process.
            *   **Orthodox:** Tend to avoid the legal language of "justification." They focus more on *theosis* (deification/union with God), of which forgiveness is a necessary part. Salvation is less a legal transaction and more a therapeutic, ontological transformation.
            *   **New Perspective Scholars (NPP):** Argue the historical Protestant reading is mistaken. Paul is not contrasting "faith" with "moral effort." He is contrasting "faith in Jesus" with "works of the law"—the ethnic boundary markers (circumcision, Sabbath, food laws) that separated Jews from Gentiles. Justification, in this view, is God's declaration of who belongs to the covenant people (now including Gentiles) based on faith, not ethnic identity or Torah-observance.

    *   **Sanctification and Union with Christ:**
        *   **Romans 6:1-14, 23:** The new reality of being dead to sin and alive to God *in Christ*. "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life."
        *   **Romans 8:1-4, 12-17:** Life in the Spirit, freedom from condemnation, and adoption as children and heirs of God.
        *   **Theological Comments:** All agree this describes the Christian life after justification. **Wesleyans** particularly emphasize the possibility of "Christian perfection" or entire sanctification in this life. **Catholics** see this as part of the ongoing process of justification. **Calvinists and Lutherans** see sanctification as a necessary fruit of justification, but one that remains imperfect until glorification.

    *   **Divine Sovereignty and Election:**
        *   **Romans 8:28-30:** The "Golden Chain of Salvation" (foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justification, glorification).
        *   **Romans 9:10-23:** The core of the debate, using Jacob and Esau and the "potter and the clay" analogy.
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Calvinists:** The definitive text for unconditional election. God sovereignly chooses individuals for salvation out of His good pleasure, not based on any foreseen quality in them. The "Golden Chain" is unbreakable. This is monergism.
            *   **Arminians:** Argue foreknowledge comes first logically: God predestines those He *foreknew* would freely believe. Romans 9 is interpreted corporately—God's choice of peoples (Israel, Gentiles) for historical purposes, not a blueprint for individual salvation.
            *   **Molinists:** Propose that God's foreknowledge includes "middle knowledge"—what any free creature *would* do in any possible world. God then actualizes a world in which those He wishes to save will freely choose Him when placed in specific circumstances.
            *   **Lutherans:** Affirm unconditional election to salvation but reject "double predestination" (that God also actively predestines people for damnation).
            *   **Catholics & Orthodox:** Generally reject a strict Calvinistic predestination, affirming human free will's role in cooperating with God's grace. God's will is for all to be saved, but humans can reject this offer.

*   **B. The Book of Galatians**
    *   **Defense of Justification by Faith Alone:**
        *   **Galatians 1:6-9:** A stern warning against any "other gospel," specifically one that adds requirements like circumcision to faith for salvation.
        *   **Galatians 2:16, 21:** "a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ... if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose."
        *   **Galatians 3:10-14:** Christ became a curse for us to redeem us from the curse of the Law.
        *   **Galatians 3:23-26:** The Law described as a "guardian" or "tutor" meant to lead us to Christ.
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Protestants (Lutheran, Calvinist, Arminian):** This is the "Magna Carta" of Christian liberty and justification by faith alone. It is seen as a polemic against legalism—the attempt to earn God's favor through works.
            *   **Catholics:** Agree that one cannot be justified by works of the Old Law apart from Christ, but distinguish these "works of the law" from the "good works" (of charity, etc.) that are the fruit of infused grace and necessary for the continuation of justification.
            *   **New Perspective Scholars (NPP):** Like in Romans, they argue "works of the law" here are not "self-righteous deeds" but the Jewish identity markers the Judaizers were trying to impose on Gentile believers. Paul's point is that Gentiles do not have to become Jews to be part of God's people. Justification by faith is the basis for a unified Jew-Gentile church.

*   **C. The Book of Ephesians**
    *   **Election and Predestination in Christ:**
        *   **Ephesians 1:3-12:** A hymn detailing God's salvific plan, including choosing believers "in him before the foundation of the world" and predestining them for adoption.
    *   **Salvation by Grace through Faith:**
        *   **Ephesians 2:1-10:** A concise summary of salvation. Key phrases: "dead in... trespasses," "made us alive together with Christ," "by grace you have been saved through faith... it is the gift of God, not a result of works."
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Calvinists:** The word "dead" proves total inability, requiring God's monergistic, irresistible grace to regenerate a person *before* they can believe. The choice "in him" (Eph 1) is individual and unconditional.
            *   **Arminians:** Argue the choice "in him" is corporate: God chose the *plan* (salvation in Christ) and all who unite themselves to Christ by faith become part of this chosen group. "Dead in trespasses" describes the state from which God's prevenient grace must rescue us, enabling a free response.
            *   **Lutherans:** Agree with Calvinists on total inability and monergistic regeneration.
            *   **Catholics/Orthodox:** See the grace described here as fully operative in baptism, where one is made alive in Christ.

# **Part 2: The Gospel Narratives — Salvation Demonstrated and Proclaimed**

*(These texts show salvation in action and proclamation through the life and words of Jesus.)*

*   **A. The Gospel of John**
    *   **The New Birth and God's Love:**
        *   **John 1:12-13:** Right to become children of God is given to those who believe, born "not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God." (Debated: monergistic vs. synergistic birth).
        *   **John 3:3-8, 16-18:** Jesus' dialogue with Nicodemus on being "born again" (or "from above") and the declaration, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
        *   **Theological Comments:** "Born of water and the Spirit" is key. **Catholics, Orthodox, and Lutherans** see a clear reference to baptism. **Most other Protestants** see "water" as a metaphor for spiritual cleansing or physical birth, with the emphasis on spiritual regeneration by the Holy Spirit.
    *   **Divine Initiative and Human Response (Debated):**
        *   **John 6:37, 44, 65:** Jesus' statements: "All that the Father gives me will come to me," and "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."
        *   **Theological Comments:** A key text for the **Calvinist** doctrine of Irresistible Grace (the "drawing" is effectual). **Arminians** interpret "draws" (*helkuō*) as a wooing or enabling that can be resisted, pointing to John 12:32 ("I... will draw all people to myself") as proof of its universal, non-effectual nature.
    *   **Exclusivity and Security:**
        *   **John 10:27-29:** The Good Shepherd: "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." A foundational text for the **Calvinist** and **Free Grace** doctrine of eternal security ("Perseverance of the Saints"). **Arminians** argue the security is conditional upon the sheep continuing to hear His voice and follow.
        *   **John 14:6:** Jesus’ exclusive claim: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (Central for all orthodox views against pluralism).
        *   **John 15:1-6:** The Vine and the Branches. Jesus warns that branches that do not bear fruit will be "taken away" and thrown into the fire. A key text for **Arminians** and **Catholics** to argue that one can be "in Christ" (a branch) and yet be cut off, losing salvation. **Calvinists** argue these are non-fruit-bearing, false professors who were never truly connected to the Vine.

*   **B. The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke)**
    *   **The Mission of the Son:**
        *   **Mark 10:45 (cf. Matthew 20:28):** "...to give his life as a ransom for many." Central to Penal Substitutionary Atonement theory. The scope of "many" is debated (**Calvinists**: the elect; **Arminians**: all, but only effective for many).
        *   **Luke 19:10:** "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost" (context of Zacchaeus).
    *   **Parables of Salvation:**
        *   **Luke 15:1-32:** The parables of the Lost Sheep, Lost Coin, and Prodigal Son. **All traditions** see this as a beautiful illustration of God's seeking, forgiving love. **Arminians** highlight the human response of repentance ("he came to his senses").
        *   **Luke 18:9-14:** The Pharisee and the Tax Collector. Illustrates justification based on humble repentance ("God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"), not self-righteous works.
    *   **Conditions of Discipleship:**
        *   **Matthew 7:21-23:** "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father." A crucial text for **all traditions** emphasizing that true faith must be accompanied by obedience.
        *   **Matthew 25:31-46:** The Sheep and the Goats. The final judgment is depicted as being based on works of mercy done (or not done) to "the least of these." **Catholics** use this to support their view of faith and works. **Protestants** see the works as the inevitable evidence of a true, regenerate heart, not the basis of salvation itself.
    *   **The Basis for Proclamation:**
        *   **Matthew 28:18-20:** The Great Commission. Rooted in the authority of the risen Christ and commanding baptism and teaching.

# **Part 3: The Applied and Developing Doctrine — The Acts and General Epistles**

*(These texts show how the early church understood, preached, and addressed issues related to salvation.)*

*   **A. The Book of Acts (The Kerygma)**
    *   **Acts 2:37-39:** Peter's call to "Repent and be baptized... for the forgiveness of your sins." **Sacramental traditions** (Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran) see repentance and baptism as an inseparable package for entry into the covenant. **Most Baptists and non-sacramental traditions** see baptism as an outward sign and public testimony of an inward repentance and faith that have already occurred.
    *   **Acts 4:12:** "...there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." The core of Christian exclusivism.
    *   **Acts 16:30-31:** "'What must I do to be saved?' And they said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved.'" A touchstone for **Evangelicals** on the simplicity and primacy of belief.

*   **B. 2 Corinthians (The Great Exchange)**
    *   **2 Corinthians 5:17-21:** "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation... God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
    *   **Theological Comments:** This is arguably the most potent summary of substitutionary atonement and imputed righteousness in the Bible. Verse 21 is the "great exchange." **Protestants** see this as the very mechanism of justification. **Catholics** would see "becoming the righteousness of God" as referring to the infused, sanctifying grace that makes one righteous. **Orthodox** focus on "new creation," seeing a real, ontological change in the believer.

*   **C. The Book of Hebrews**
    *   **Christ's Superior and Final Sacrifice:**
        *   **Hebrews 9:11-14, 24-28 & Hebrews 10:10-14:** Christ's once-for-all sacrifice has "perfected for all time those who are being sanctified."
        *   **Theological Comments:** This is central for all, but poses a question for **Catholic** theology regarding the Mass as a "sacrifice." Catholic doctrine clarifies the Mass is not a *re-sacrificing* of Christ, but a re-presentation of his one, eternal sacrifice.
    *   **The Warning Passages (Highly Debated):**
        *   **Hebrews 6:4-8 & Hebrews 10:26-31:** Describe people who were "enlightened," "tasted the heavenly gift," and "shared in the Holy Spirit" but then "fall away," for whom it is "impossible to restore them again to repentance."
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Arminians/Wesleyans:** The clearest proof that genuine believers can commit apostasy and forfeit salvation, losing it irrecoverably.
            *   **Calvinists:** Argue these describe unregenerate members of the covenant community who have experienced the blessings of the church but were never truly born again. Their "falling away" reveals, not loses, their unsaved state.
            *   **Lutherans:** Similar to the Arminian view; they believe a true Christian can fall away.
            *   **Catholics:** This supports the doctrine of mortal sin, through which a person can lose the state of sanctifying grace and, without repentance, be lost.

*   **D. The Epistle of James**
    *   **The Relationship Between Faith and Works:**
        *   **James 2:14-26:** States "faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead," and concludes "a person is justified by works and not by faith alone" (v. 24).
        *   **Theological Comments:**
            *   **Catholics & Orthodox:** See this as a plain refutation of the Protestant doctrine of *sola fide*. It confirms their view that justification requires both faith and cooperative works of charity.
            *   **Protestants (Calvinist, Arminian, Lutheran):** Harmonize James with Paul. They argue Paul is talking about the *root* of justification (faith alone) while James is talking about the *fruit* (the evidence) of a justified life. A faith that does not produce works is not true, saving faith to begin with. Martin Luther famously struggled with this book, calling it an "epistle of straw," though this view is not representative of Lutheranism today.

*   **E. The Petrine Epistles**
    *   **The Nature and Security of Salvation:**
        *   **1 Peter 1:3-5:** Describes salvation as a "living hope" and an inheritance "kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith." **Calvinists** see God's power as the primary guard. **Arminians** highlight "through faith," meaning the guarding is conditional on continuing faith.
        *   **1 Peter 2:24:** "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness." A clear statement of substitutionary atonement and its sanctifying purpose.
    *   **God's Universal Saving Will (Debated):**
        *   **2 Peter 3:9:** "The Lord is... not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."
        *   **Theological Comments:** A cornerstone text for **Arminians, Catholics, and Orthodox** regarding God's universal salvific will for every individual. **Calvinists** interpret "all" as "all kinds of people" (Jews and Gentiles) or, more commonly, as "all of the elect." The verse is addressed "toward you" (believers), meaning God is patient to gather all of His chosen people.

*   **F. The Johannine Epistles (1-3 John)**
    *   **The Tests of True Faith and Assurance:**
        *   **1 John 1:7-9:** Walking in the light and confession of sin are tied to forgiveness and cleansing.
        *   **1 John 2:3-6:** "And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments."
        *   **1 John 3:14:** "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers."
        *   **1 John 5:11-13:** "And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son... I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life."
        *   **Theological Comments:** John provides a different framework for assurance than Paul. While Paul grounds assurance in God's objective promises (Romans 8), John grounds it in the subjective evidence in a believer's life: doctrinal orthodoxy (believing Jesus is the Christ), moral righteousness (obedience), and relational love (loving fellow believers). This is important for all traditions but is especially emphasized in traditions that stress sanctification as evidence of salvation.

# **Part 4: The Old Testament Foundation — Types and Shadows of Salvation (Historical vs. ANE Scholarly Views)**

*(These texts provide the indispensable framework for salvation, but their interpretation has been enriched and challenged by modern scholarship. This section will contrast the traditional/historical Christian reading with perspectives informed by recent Ancient Near East (ANE) scholarship.)*

*   **A. The Sacrificial System and Covenants (Leviticus, Exodus)**
    *   **Historical/Traditional View (Emphasizing Legal Substitution):**
        *   This perspective, dominant in Protestantism (especially for **Calvinists** and **Lutherans**), reads the OT sacrificial system primarily through a legal and typological lens. Each element is a direct prefigurement of Christ's work in the framework of Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA).
        *   **Exodus 12 (The Passover):** The lamb's death is a direct substitute for the firstborn. The application of its blood is a saving act that averts the judicial wrath of God (the Destroyer). This is a clear type of Christ's blood protecting believers from final judgment.
        *   **Leviticus 16 (Day of Atonement):** This is the quintessential model for PSA. The first goat is a *propitiatory* sacrifice, its blood satisfying God's justice. The second goat (the scapegoat) is *expiatory*, physically carrying the legal guilt of the people away. Christ fulfills both roles perfectly.
        *   **Leviticus 17:11:** The principle "life for a life." Blood makes atonement because a life is given in place of another, satisfying the penalty of death required by sin.

    *   **New "Ancient Near East Scholarship" View (Emphasizing Purity and Cosmic Order):**
        *   This view, often associated with scholars like Jacob Milgrom and integrated into the work of figures like N.T. Wright and **The Bible Project**, argues that the primary concern of the Levitical system was not legal payment but **ritual purification** and the restoration of **cosmic order**.
        *   **Core Idea:** Sin and impurity don't just create legal guilt; they release a tangible pollution or "miasma" that defiles sacred space (the Tabernacle/Temple). If the sanctuary becomes too polluted, the holy presence of God must depart, leading to cosmic chaos and death for Israel.
        *   **Exodus 12 (The Passover):** The blood on the doorposts is seen less as a payment and more as an *apotropaic* sign—a ritual detergent or protective symbol that wards off the destructive forces of chaos and death, marking the home as part of God's restored creation-space.
        *   **Leviticus 16 (Day of Atonement):** The primary purpose is explicitly stated as purifying the *Holy Place* and the *altar* from the defilement caused by the people's sins (Lev. 16:16). The blood is a ritual detergent, cleansing God's dwelling so He can remain with His people. The scapegoat removes the polluting agent (sin) from the community's midst, restoring order. This is a **Sanctuary Purification** model of atonement, not a primarily legal one.
        *   **Leviticus 17:11:** In this view, blood doesn't primarily pay a debt; it is a powerful symbol of life used as a ritual cleansing agent to purge the effects of death and sin.

*   **B. The Prophetic Hope**
    *   **Genesis 3:15 (The *Protoevangelium*):**
        *   **Historical View:** A direct Messianic prophecy of Christ (the offspring of the woman) decisively crushing Satan (the serpent).
        *   **ANE Lens:** This is framed as a cosmic conflict between humanity's representative and the chaos-monster (a common ANE trope). The promise is not just about a legal victory, but about the ultimate triumph of God's order over the forces of chaos, sin, and death that entered creation.

    *   **Isaiah 53 (The Suffering Servant):**
        *   **Historical View:** The clearest OT text teaching Penal Substitutionary Atonement. The language of substitution ("he was pierced for our transgressions... the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all") is seen as unambiguous. It is a cornerstone for **Calvinists**, **Lutherans**, and most **Evangelicals**.
        *   **ANE Lens:** While not denying the substitutionary language, this perspective highlights the Servant as Israel's true representative who absorbs the consequences of the nation's covenant failure (exile, death) into himself. His suffering is not so much to appease an angry Father as it is to exhaust the destructive power of evil and covenant curse, thereby creating a new exodus and a renewed people. The focus is on defeating evil and restoring the covenant, rather than on satisfying a legal requirement of divine wrath.

    *   **Jeremiah 31:31-34 & Ezekiel 36:25-27:** Both traditional and new scholarship see these as foundational prophecies of the New Covenant. The ANE perspective would emphasize the language of transformation ("new heart," "new spirit") as God's ultimate solution to the problem of human-generated chaos, creating a people who can live in accordance with His cosmic order.

# **Part 5: Soteriology in Other Contexts and Debates**

*(These texts are frequently employed in specific soteriological debates, such as universalism or the role of the will.)*

*   **A. Passages Used in Universal Reconciliation Debates**
    *   **1 Corinthians 15:22:** "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive."
    *   **Colossians 1:19-20:** "...through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven."
    *   **1 Timothy 2:3-4:** God our Savior, "who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
    *   **Theological Comments:**
        *   **Christian Universalists:** These are pillar texts, suggesting Christ's reconciliation is as extensive as Adam's fall, ultimately encompassing every person. God's desire for all to be saved will eventually be accomplished.
        *   **Mainstream Traditions (Calvinist, Arminian, Catholic, etc.):** Argue this is a misreading. In 1 Cor 15, "all *in Christ*" are made alive, not all humanity universally. In Col 1, the reconciliation of "all things" refers to the subjugation of all creation to Christ's authority, restoring cosmic order, not the personal salvation of all intelligent beings. In 1 Tim 2, "all people" means "all kinds of people" (kings, slaves, etc.), not every single individual, or it expresses God's disposition/desire, not His determined decree.

*   **B. Philippians (The Paradox of Divine Work and Human Action)**
    *   **Philippians 2:12-13:** "...work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
    *   **Theological Comments:** This verse is a paradox held in tension. **Arminians** and **Catholics** emphasize the "work out" portion as evidence of necessary human cooperation and synergy. **Calvinists** and **Lutherans** emphasize the "for it is God who works in you" portion as evidence that even our willing and working are monergistically produced by God's grace. Both sides agree both clauses are true, but they differ on the logical and causal relationship between them.

*   **C. The Book of Revelation (Soteriology in Apocalyptic Imagery)**
    *   **Revelation 5:9-10:** The song to the Lamb who was slain, who "ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation."
    *   **Revelation 7:14:** The saved are those who have "washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
    *   **Revelation 20:12, 15:** The final judgment, where salvation is synonymous with one's name being "found written in the book of life."
    *   **Revelation 22:17:** The final, free gospel invitation: "The Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come.' ...let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price." This last verse is a powerful summary of the gospel as a free gift available to all who desire it.
	*   **Revelation 3:20 (The Call to a Lukewarm Church):** Christ's message to the church of Laodicea: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me."
	    *   **Theological Comments (and Correction of Misuse):** Perhaps one of the most popularly misused verses in modern evangelism, this passage is almost universally presented as a picture of Jesus gently knocking on the door of an individual unbeliever's heart, pleading to be let in for initial salvation. Countless tracts and sermons use it as a primary tool for evangelism.
	    *   However, the context reveals this interpretation to be a **blatant decontextualization**. The verse is addressed not to unbelievers, but to the *church* of Laodicea—a body of believers Christ describes as "lukewarm," disgustingly self-sufficient, and spiritually blind (Rev 3:16-17). The shocking image is not of Jesus waiting to save a lost soul, but of Jesus being *outside his own church*, knocking to be let back into a place of intimacy and prominence. The call to "open the door" is a call for a complacent church to **repent** (v. 19) and restore fellowship with its Lord. While it illustrates the personal nature of fellowship with Christ, its primary application is a call to renewal for the apathetic believer or church, not a formula for an unbeliever's conversion.
