Phew! We have made our way through this jungle of Reformed and Arminian viewpoints. However, it is easy to forget that this debate is, in many ways, a family argument. The vast majority of Christians in the world today, and throughout history, belong to the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. These ancient churches possess their own rich, deeply nuanced, and time-honored ways of understanding salvation. To be well-rounded and well-informed followers of Christ, we owe it to ourselves and to them to understand their perspectives, not to score debating points, but to appreciate the breadth of the Christian witness.
# **The Eastern Orthodox View: Synergy and Theosis**

It is often wrongly and unfairly claimed that the Orthodox view of salvation is simply "salvation by works," or a form of Pelagianism (the heresy that humans can earn salvation on their own merit). This is a profound misunderstanding. The Orthodox Church vehemently rejects the idea that humans can save themselves or even take the first step toward God without Him. They affirm with all of scripture that God’s grace is absolutely necessary, primary, and the sole source of our salvation. The difference lies in how that grace is understood to interact with the human person.

The core concept for the Orthodox is **Synergy**, which means cooperation. They believe salvation is a partnership between divine grace and human free will. A common and beautiful Orthodox analogy is that God, in His grace, extends His hand to a person drowning. Salvation comes entirely from the strength of God’s arm, but the individual must willingly extend their own hand to grasp His. God will not force salvation upon an unwilling soul, but our ability to even desire to respond is itself a gift made possible by His initiating grace. While this may sound similar to Arminianism, the Orthodox emphasis is less on a single, decisive moment of choice and more on a lifelong journey of cooperation with God.

This cooperation is not an end in itself, but serves a much grander purpose: **Theosis**. Often translated as ‘deification’ or ‘divinization,’ this is the ultimate goal of salvation in Orthodoxy. It is the lifelong, transformative process by which a believer, empowered by God's grace, becomes more and more like God. This is not a metaphysical merging with God, but a participation in the "divine nature" as St. Peter writes (2 Peter 1:4). Salvation is thus seen less as a one-time legal declaration (as in many Protestant views of justification) and more as a therapeutic journey. We are sick with sin, and God’s grace, working through prayer, ascetic struggle, and the Church’s sacraments (which they call 'Mysteries'), heals us, restores the image of God within us, and draws us into ever-deepening union with Him. The Orthodox view, therefore, is a dynamic process of *becoming* like Christ through a synergistic partnership with God, with the ultimate goal being a loving, transformative union.

# **The Roman Catholic View: Grace, Justification, and the Augustinian Heritage**

Like the Orthodox view, Catholic soteriology is often caricatured by Protestants as a system of "works-righteousness." However, the official teaching of the Catholic Church, articulated most forcefully at the Council of Trent, explicitly condemns the idea that one can be saved by works done apart from God's grace. The Catholic Catechism states that the initial grace that moves us toward God is entirely unmerited; it is a free gift. The divergence from Protestantism is not over *whether* grace is necessary, but over *how* that grace functions in the process of justification.

For Catholics, justification is not a one-time event, but a process. **Initial Justification** is understood to be a free and unearned gift from God, typically received at baptism. In this moment, the soul is cleansed of original sin and is *infused* with sanctifying grace—a real, qualitative change that makes the person truly pleasing to God. From that point, a believer enters into **Ongoing Justification**. This is a lifelong process that can be *increased* through good works (which are themselves understood to be the fruit of God's grace) and prayer, or tragically, can be *lost* through mortal sin. This entire journey is lived out within the life of the Church, which mediates God's grace primarily through the sacraments, especially Baptism for initiation, Penance (or Reconciliation) for the forgiveness of sins committed after baptism, and the Eucharist, which nourishes the soul with Christ's own life.

This raises a fascinating and crucial question: Since both John Calvin and the Catholic Church claim the great Saint Augustine of Hippo as their theological father, where did they diverge so sharply? It's true that both traditions build upon Augustine’s powerful teachings on the reality of original sin, the bondage of the human will, the absolute necessity of God’s sovereign grace to initiate salvation, and even a doctrine of predestination. They share a common ancestor, but they are not identical twins. The key differences are profound:

1.  **The Nature of Justification:** This is the heart of the disagreement. For Calvin and the Reformers, justification is a one-time, forensic (legal) declaration. God declares a sinner "not guilty" by *imputing*—or crediting—the perfect righteousness of Christ to their account. For Catholicism, following a different strand of Augustine's thought, justification is a process where God's grace *infuses* righteousness into the believer, making them actually, inherently righteous and holy. It is more like a divine medicine that heals than a judge's gavel that acquits.
2.  **Irresistible Grace vs. Cooperative Grace:** While Augustine held a very strong view of God's effective grace, Calvinism developed this into the doctrine of **Irresistible Grace**, meaning God’s saving grace cannot be ultimately refused by the elect. Official Catholicism, while affirming God's grace is always primary and prevenient, holds that a person retains the ability to cooperate with or reject God's subsequent graces. The grace to persevere to the end is seen as a special gift, but not guaranteed in the same way as in the Reformed system.
3.  **Assurance of Salvation:** This follows logically from the view of justification. Because the Calvinist sees justification as a final, unchangeable verdict from God, they can have a high degree of assurance about their final salvation. In Catholicism, because justification is a process that can be lost through mortal sin, a person generally cannot have absolute certainty of their final salvation (though they are encouraged to have a confident hope), as it depends on their future perseverance in a state of grace.

Ultimately, Calvinism can be seen as a form of *radicalized Augustinianism*. The Reformers took Augustine's core principles about God's sovereign grace and developed them with a different, forensic understanding of justification, leading them away from the sacramental system and toward the destinctives of the Five Points. Catholicism, while also claiming Augustine, integrated his powerful insights on grace into a pre-existing sacramental and ecclesial framework that sees salvation as a lifelong process of transformation within the Body of Christ, the Church.

Of course. This final section is crucial. It needs to pivot from charitable description to clear-eyed conviction, explaining the fundamental principle that creates the divide without undoing the respectful tone established earlier. Here is a concluding section crafted to achieve that balance.
# **The Foundation of the Divide: *Sola Scriptura***

Having journeyed through these soteriologies, we can appreciate their internal coherence, their pastoral depth, and the way they have sustained the faith of billions. A Protestant can and should acknowledge the beauty in the Orthodox vision of *theosis* and respect the rigorous intellectual tradition behind Catholic thought on justification. And yet, for the historic Protestant consciousness, a fundamental question emerges that creates an unbridgeable—though hopefully not uncharitable—divide. This question is simply about ultimate authority. This brings us to the very bedrock of the Reformation itself: the principle of *Sola Scriptura*.

This principle is often misunderstood. *Sola Scriptura* does not mean that tradition, church history, or theological reasoning have no value. On the contrary, the Reformers were deeply learned men who engaged seriously with Augustine, Anselm, and others. Rather, *Sola Scriptura* teaches that the Bible alone is the final, inspired, and infallible authority for Christian faith and practice. All traditions, all church councils, all papal decrees, and all theological systems—no matter how venerable or intellectually compelling—are secondary. They must be tested by, and are subordinate to, the clear witness of the written Word of God.

It is this foundational commitment that makes the Catholic and Orthodox systems ultimately untenable *for a Protestant*. When a Protestant reads the Apostle Paul’s arguments in Romans and Galatians, the language of justification appears overwhelmingly forensic—a legal declaration. The Greek word *logizomai*, often translated "reckon" or "credit," points to an *imputed* status, not an *infused* quality. The idea that justification is a lifelong process that can be increased by works and lost by sin, mediated primarily through a sacramental system, is seen not as a development of biblical teaching, but as a departure from it—a complex structure built on a foundation other than Scripture alone.

Similarly, while the goal of becoming more like Christ is central to all Christian teaching, the highly developed system of *theosis*, with its specific path through asceticism and the Mysteries, is viewed as a tradition that goes beyond what Scripture explicitly mandates as the path to salvation. The sacraments are cherished as vital signs and seals of God's promises, but the idea that they are the primary *means* of conferring justifying grace is seen as a tradition that elevates the Church and its rites to a place of authority reserved for Scripture alone. Consequently, the biblical promise of assurance, rooted in the finished work of Christ and the finality of God's declaration, is seen as a birthright for the believer—a comfort that is obscured by a system where salvation depends on lifelong cooperation and perseverance within a specific sacramental framework.

This is why the internal Protestant debate between the Reformed and Arminian traditions is fought so fiercely on the terrain of exegesis. Both sides, in their own way, are attempting to build their entire system from the ground up, using only the bricks and mortar of the biblical text. The argument is about which interpretation is more faithful to the totality of that text. For the Protestant, the Catholic and Orthodox views, for all their historical weight and wisdom, have introduced other sources of authority that shape their reading of the Bible. In the end, our final confidence is anchored not in the accumulated wisdom of a beautiful tradition, but in the clarity, power, and sufficiency of what God has revealed to us in His written Word.
