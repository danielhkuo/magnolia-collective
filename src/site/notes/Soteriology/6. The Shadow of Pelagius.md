To grasp the conversations happening in the Church today, we often need to become historians. When we talk about salvation—how God saves us and what our role is—we are walking on ground that was mapped out centuries ago. Understanding this history helps us see the foundations of our own beliefs more clearly and protects us from well-meaning but subtle and significant errors. We’ll begin by looking at two of the most influential ideas ever to challenge the Church’s understanding of grace.
## A History of Pelagianism: The Gospel of "Try Harder"

In the early 5th century, as the Western Roman Empire was crumbling under immense social and political pressure, a British monk named Pelagius arrived in Rome. He was a devout and moral man, but he was shocked by what he saw. He felt Christians had become lazy, using God’s grace as an excuse for sin. His message of moral self-reliance and discipline resonated with traditional Roman ideals of virtue. He famously bristled at a prayer from the great theologian Augustine of Hippo: "Grant what you command, and command what you will." To Pelagius, this sounded like a recipe for moral passivity. If we have to ask God to *give* us the ability to obey Him, are we really responsible for our actions?

In response, Pelagius developed a system of teaching that can be boiled down to a simple, powerful idea: **You are capable of being good on your own.** He taught that:

1.  **We are born good, not broken.** Pelagius argued that Adam’s sin only harmed Adam. It set a bad example, but it did not corrupt human nature itself. Therefore, every baby is born in the same innocent state Adam was in before he fell. There is no such thing as "original sin."
2.  **We have the power to be perfect.** Because our will is not broken or enslaved by sin, Pelagius taught that we have the full, free ability to choose good over evil at all times. A person could, if they tried hard enough, live a life entirely without sin.
3.  **God’s grace is primarily an external help.** For Pelagius, grace wasn't a necessary, internal power that changes our hearts. Instead, it was God's external assistance: giving us the Law to show us the right way, the example of Christ to inspire us, and our own reason and free will to empower us. Grace is like a good coach or a helpful road map; it shows us the way, but we have to run the race ourselves.

The Church, led by Augustine, immediately recognized the danger. If we can save ourselves through our own good works, then why did Jesus have to die on the cross? If we are not born broken, what is the point of infant baptism for the forgiveness of sins, a practice already widespread in the Church? Pelagius's teaching, while born from a desire for morality, ultimately cut the heart out of the gospel. It turned salvation from a divine rescue into a human achievement. As a result, Pelagianism was formally and forcefully condemned as a heresy by the Church at the Councils of Carthage (418 AD) and Ephesus (431 AD).

## A History of Semi-Pelagianism: The "Meet God Halfway" Compromise

While pure Pelagianism was rejected, its core ideas didn't disappear. Many felt that Augustine’s view—that fallen humanity is spiritually dead and completely unable to choose God without His direct, regenerating intervention—went too far. They looked for a middle ground.

This 'middle way' was not called "Semi-Pelagianism" by its proponents. That label was applied later by its opponents. In their own time, figures like the monk John Cassian from Southern Gaul saw themselves as defending a more ancient and balanced tradition against what they perceived as Augustine's radical new ideas.

They agreed with Augustine that Adam’s sin did indeed affect all of humanity and that God's grace is absolutely necessary for salvation. But they disagreed on one critical, decisive point: **the origin of the first step of faith** (in Latin, the *initium fidei*).

Here is the core of their belief: While we are fallen and sick with sin, we are not spiritually dead. We are like a drowning person who is weak but still conscious. In this weakened state, we still have enough good left in our fallen nature to make the **first move** toward God. We can, of our own natural ability, desire to be saved, cry out for help, and choose to accept the gospel. Once we make that first move—the beginning of our faith—*then* God’s grace steps in to help us the rest of the way, cooperating with our will to complete our salvation.

Let's revisit the drowning person analogy:
*   **Augustine’s view:** The person is a corpse at the bottom of the ocean, "dead in... sins" (Ephesians 2:1). God has to dive down, resurrect them, bring them to the surface, *and then* they become aware that they have been saved. The rescue is 100% God's work from start to finish.
*   **The Semi-Pelagian view:** The person is flailing in the water, weak but alive. They have to decide to splash, wave their arm, or cry for help. Once they do that, God throws them the life preserver and pulls them in. That initial cry for help—the decisive act—comes from them.

While this "meet God halfway" idea was appealing, the Church ultimately saw the same fundamental problem. Who gets the ultimate credit for salvation? If the decisive factor is my choice to initiate the process, then salvation begins with me, not with God. The Council of Orange in 529 AD condemned this view as well, declaring that even the desire for faith, the first turning of the will toward God, is itself a gift produced in us by the grace of the Holy Spirit.

## Isn't This Just Arminianism?

Before moving to the modern day, it's crucial to address a common point of confusion. Some might read the Semi-Pelagian view and think it sounds like Arminianism. While they are related, there is a vital distinction.

Classical Arminians, following Jacobus Arminius, agree with Augustine and the Reformers that humanity is spiritually dead, in a state of "total depravity," and unable to make the first move toward God. Their solution is a doctrine called **Prevenient Grace**. They believe God gives a universal, internal, "preceding" grace to every single person, which overcomes the bondage of their will and restores their ability to freely choose or reject the gospel. For an Arminian, God still makes the first move *internally* in everyone.

As we will see, this is not what Provisionism teaches. This distinction is the key to understanding the modern debate.

## Defining Provisionism

This brings us to **Provisionism**, a more recent theological system most prominently taught by Leighton Flowers. It presents itself as a biblically balanced alternative to both Calvinism and classical Arminianism. Its proponents are passionate about upholding what they see as God's universal love and genuine human responsibility.

Provisionism is often summarized with the acrostic **PROVIDE**:

*   **P**eople sin, which separates them from God.
*   **R**esponsible: Humans are **able to respond** to God’s call for reconciliation.
*   **O**pen Door: Salvation is open to anyone who comes by faith.
*   **V**icarious Atonement: Christ’s death provided a way for anyone to be saved.
*   **I**lluminating Grace: God’s grace, through the Holy Spirit, clearly reveals the truth of the gospel so that people can respond.
*   **D**estroyed: Those who refuse to believe are destroyed.
*   **E**ternal Security: True believers are eternally secure.

Let's place this modern system into our historical context by asking the same crucial question: According to Provisionism, *where does the beginning of faith come from?*

Proponents of Provisionism will rightly insist they believe in grace. However, the critical question is always: *what kind of grace, and what does it do?*

Provisionism teaches that the fall did not leave people "totally unable" to believe. Instead, fallen humans **retain the natural ability** to respond to God's call. The work of the Holy Spirit, called "Illuminating Grace," is understood primarily as an *external* work. The Spirit works through the preaching of the gospel to make the truth clear and persuasive. Crucially, it does not perform a necessary *internal* work of regeneration *before* faith to give the sinner a new heart and the very ability to believe.

## An Inescapable Parallel

Here the historical parallels become unavoidable. The choice to believe, according to Provisionism, originates in the sinner's own will, responding to the externally presented gospel.

Focus on the 'R' in the acrostic: **"Responsible: Humans are able to respond."** This assertion of an innate, post-Fall ability stands in direct conflict with the Church's historic conclusion at the Council of Orange, which stated that any "right choice relating to... eternal life" is impossible "without the illumination and inspiration of the Holy Spirit" changing our will.

Provisionism argues the Fall caused "relational estrangement" but left our "natural ability" to believe intact. This minimizes sin’s deeper consequences, what theologians call the *noetic effects*—the way sin darkens our minds (Romans 1:21) and makes our hearts actively hostile to God (Romans 8:7). By asserting that the unregenerate person already possesses the necessary ability to accept the gospel, Provisionism functionally denies the biblical doctrine of human bondage to sin that makes regenerating grace a necessity (John 6:44, 1 Corinthians 2:14).

This brings us to the heart of the matter. Let's ask the ultimate question: "Why did one person believe the gospel and another person, hearing the exact same message, did not?"
*   The historic Augustinian, Reformed, and even Lutheran answer points to God: God's sovereign grace worked inwardly in the believer to grant repentance and faith, which are themselves gifts.
*   The Provisionist answer, like the Semi-Pelagian one before it, must ultimately point to the person: **The person who believed used their innate ability more wisely or had a softer heart than the person who did not.**

In this system, the final, determinative choice originates from a power within the person themselves. The decisive factor that explains why one is saved and another is lost is not a mysterious, sovereign work of God's grace but the individual's own exercise of their free will.

Understanding this history isn't about winning theological debates or applying labels. It's about preserving the heart of the gospel. The question of who makes the first move determines who gets the ultimate glory for our salvation. Is it a joint project where God does His part, but we provide the final, decisive "yes"? Or is it a divine rescue from start to finish?

The consistent witness of the Church in its defining moments has been that salvation is of the Lord. The gospel is not about a God who makes a provision and waits to see who is good or wise enough to take it. It is about a God who so loves His lost and dead creation that He doesn't just throw a life preserver to a struggling swimmer; He dives into the depths to raise the dead to new life. True grace is the Triune God Himself in powerful, personal, rescuing action, who grants us everything we need for salvation, including the very faith to believe. To Him alone be the glory.
