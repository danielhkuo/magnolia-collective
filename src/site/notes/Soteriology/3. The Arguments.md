To chart these ancient conversations, we first need to define a few terms that serve as landmarks: **Grace** is God’s unmerited favor. **Election** refers to God’s act of choosing. The **Atonement** is Christ's reconciling work. **Free Will** is the human capacity for choice. While all historic Christian traditions use these words, they assemble them into very different pictures of our rescue. To understand these differences, we won't compare them point-by-point, but will instead follow the story of salvation as it unfolds, asking four fundamental questions.

### Question 1: What Is Our Starting Point? The Problem of the Human Condition

Before we can appreciate the cure, we must agree on the diagnosis. All traditions agree humanity is fallen and needs God's grace, but they differ on the severity of our spiritual sickness.

The Calvinist and Lutheran traditions teach what is called **Total Depravity** or **Radical Corruption**. This does not mean people are as wicked as they could possibly be, but that sin has infected *every part* of our being—our minds, our emotions, and crucially, our wills. The will is not neutral or merely weakened; it is in bondage to sin and actively hostile to God. In this state, a person is spiritually dead, utterly unable to choose or even desire their own rescue. The analogy is that of a **corpse**: it cannot decide to live. Life must be sovereignly imparted to it from an outside source. Therefore, for salvation to begin, God must first perform a miraculous work of **regeneration**, being born again, sovereignly changing the very nature of the heart to give it new life and the ability to believe.

The Arminian view agrees that humanity is fallen, corrupted by sin, and completely unable to save itself. However, it holds that God’s loving desire for all to be saved leads Him to extend **Prevenient Grace**—a grace that “goes before”—to all people. This divine initiative is not saving grace itself, but a universal enabling grace that overcomes the bondage of the will, restoring to every person the freedom to genuinely respond to the Gospel. It makes a real "yes" or "no" possible. The analogy is that of a **drowning person**: they are helpless and will surely die on their own, but this grace gives them just enough strength to grasp the lifeline God throws to them.

In the Catholic and Orthodox understanding, the fall, or **Original Sin**, is primarily understood as the loss of **sanctifying grace**—the supernatural life of God in the soul with which humanity was created. This loss wounded our natural faculties, resulting in a darkened intellect and a weakened will. While we are incapable of reaching heaven on our own, the "image of God" in us is marred, not erased; the will is severely impaired but not destroyed. The rescue begins not with an internal spiritual nudge alone, but with a concrete, sacramental incorporation into Christ: **Baptism**. This sacrament cleanses the stain of original sin and infuses the soul with sanctifying grace for the first time, moving a person from a state of alienation to a state of divine adoption and beginning the lifelong process of healing.

Your starting point defines the entire story. Is salvation primarily a resurrection from spiritual death, an enabled choice made by a freed will, or a sacramental incorporation into the new life of the Church? This foundational belief shapes how you understand the very nature of God's grace.

### Question 2: What Was God's Solution? The Plan of Election and the Work of the Cross

This question explores God's eternal plan and its execution in history, linking His *intent* (election) with Christ's decisive *action* (atonement). This relationship between intent and action is a source of significant debate, even within traditions.

The basis of God's choice is understood in several ways. In **Unconditional Election**, the classic Calvinist view, God’s decision to save certain individuals (the elect) is based solely on His own mysterious and merciful will, not on anything He foresaw in them, including faith. Faith is not the *condition* for election, but the *result* of it; God chooses to give His elect the gift of faith. In contrast, **Conditional Election**, the Arminian view, holds that God, in His omniscience, sees who will freely choose to respond in faith to His universal offer of salvation. On the basis of this foreseen faith, He elects them. A third approach, common in Catholic theology, is **Corporate Election**, which frames election less around a list of individual names and more around God's choice of a *people*. First He chose Israel; now He chooses the **Church** as the Body of Christ. Individuals participate in this election by being baptized into this covenant community and persevering within it.

This debate over God’s intent naturally shapes the understanding of Christ's work on the cross. Many Calvinists (often called "5-point Calvinists") hold to **Definite Atonement** (or Limited Atonement), arguing that Christ's death was specifically designed to effectively and infallibly *purchase* the salvation of the elect, and only the elect. Its saving power was definite in its intent and perfectly successful in its application. Conversely, Arminians, Catholics, Lutherans, and even some "4-point Calvinists" affirm **Universal Atonement**. They believe Christ’s death was sufficient in value to pay for the sins of every person who has ever lived. The cross made salvation *available* to all, opening a path for reconciliation that is genuinely offered to everyone. It only becomes *effective*, however, for those who apply it to themselves through faith.

This gets to the heart of God’s plan. Is the plan laser-focused on redeeming you? Or is it focused on creating a saved people, the Church, which individuals like you can then freely join?

### Question 3: How Does Salvation Become Ours? The Interplay of Grace and Will

The gospel has been preached and the work is done. This question asks how that work bridges the gap to land in an individual's life. It's crucial to distinguish these views from Hyper-Calvinism, a fringe position which denies that the gospel should be offered freely to all sinners. All the historic positions below affirm a universal gospel offer.

In the Calvinist view, when God intends to save one of the elect, He issues an internal, special call that is distinct from the general gospel invitation heard by all. This call, enacted by the Holy Spirit, is **Irresistible Grace**. This doesn't mean it violates the human will. Rather, this grace is so powerful that it frees the will from its bondage to sin and changes the heart's fundamental desires. It effectively makes the sinner *willing* to come to Christ, so that they choose Him freely and joyfully because their very nature has been changed.

In the Arminian view, God’s grace is always **Resistible**. Drawing on the power of prevenient grace, the Holy Spirit convicts, woos, and enlightens a person, making the gospel offer compelling and understandable. However, this grace does not coerce. The individual’s will, having been freed, retains the ultimate ability to either cooperate with this saving grace by placing faith in Christ, or to resist it and turn away. The final decision rests with the person.

In the Catholic view, grace is understood not just as a spiritual influence but as the very life of God, often mediated through tangible means. The process begins with **Sanctifying Grace**, the stable, indwelling divine life first infused at Baptism. This state of grace is then sustained and deepened through participation in the life of the Church, especially the Eucharist (communion). Along the way, God provides **Actual Grace**—moment-by-moment divine promptings that help a person do good and avoid evil. The Christian life is therefore a continual **cooperation** with these graces, a dynamic participation in a divine reality, not just a response to a one-time proposal.

How do you experience grace? Is it a sovereign force that changes your will from the inside out? Is it a divine proposal that you, empowered, are free to accept or reject? Or is it the very life of God, into which you are incorporated and in which you must actively participate through the concrete life of the Church?

### Question 4: Can Our Salvation Be Lost? The Journey of Perseverance and Security

Once a person has entered a state of salvation, is the journey's end guaranteed? This final question directly shapes a Christian's sense of assurance and daily discipleship.

The Calvinist doctrine is the **Perseverance of the Saints**. This teaches that those whom God has genuinely regenerated and justified are kept by His divine power and will certainly persevere in faith until the end. This is often summarized (and oversimplified) by the popular phrase "Once Saved, Always Saved," but the formal doctrine is more nuanced. It emphasizes that this security is demonstrated through a life of enduring faith, not a license for sin; God’s preserving grace ensures the believer continues in that faith. Consequently, a person who ultimately and finally falls away from the faith demonstrates that their initial conversion was not genuine. Security rests entirely in God's sovereign decree and preserving power.

The Classical Arminian and Lutheran view holds to the **Possibility of Apostasy**. Because salvation is conditional upon continued faith, they believe it is possible for a person who was once a genuine believer to willfully and deliberately reject Christ and thereby forfeit their salvation. For them, the numerous biblical warnings against "falling away" are addressed to true believers and represent a real and present danger. Security is not found in a past event but is a function of a present, living, and abiding relationship with Christ.

The Catholic view centers on **Remaining in a State of Grace**. A baptized person living in a state of justification can lose this **sanctifying grace** by committing a **mortal sin**—a grave offense against God's law performed with full knowledge and deliberate consent. This act severs one's communion with God. However, this tragic state is not necessarily final. The gift of grace can be restored through the **Sacrament of Penance/Reconciliation**, where a person repents and receives divine forgiveness through the ministry of the Church. Security is found not in a one-time decision, but in remaining in communion with God and His Church, which provides a tangible path to restoration if that communion is broken.

Is your confidence found in God's unbreakable decree that guarantees your arrival? Is it found in the vitality of your present trust and your vigilance against falling away? Or is it found in your ongoing participation in the life of the Church, which offers you both the nourishment to persevere and the remedy for restoration?
