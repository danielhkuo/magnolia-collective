# Why I am a Calvinist

I get asked this question a lot. It used to make me feel awkward because people tend to make such a fuss about the label. Then it would get really heated and emotional. But I feel like I have some unique clarity that’s a little different from what others say. Just please hear me out.

Honestly, I believe Calvinism and Classical Arminianism are nearly the same in many ways, often just differing in semantics. But with two substantial differences, and that is the doctrine of Prevenient Grace and the nature of God’s Will in Arminianism. But before I go into that, I should first explain a lot of things I hear and see that I have to just say is completely wrong, with no offense to those who say these things of course I don’t mean it personally.

1.  > "God is love, and love requires free choice. Therefore, I don’t believe in predestination."

    Again, I really mean this. Don’t take it personally, but oh boy does this statement presuppose a lot. Let’s break it down together. First, it assumes a specific cultural understanding of love. If you are a Christian, you must define love by the Bible. And nowhere does the Bible define love as "ensuring the free choice of the individual."

    Consider the greatest act of love in all of history and all of the universe: Jesus’s death on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins. I want to emphasize that this was an act upon humanity. God was doing something to us.
    Imagine if the crucifixion (the greatest example of God’s love) went under this idea of love: Jesus is tried under Pontius Pilate and nailed to the cross on Golgotha... but then He stops. He realizes that because human will is the ultimate standard, He cannot guarantee that a single person will actually accept His gift. Jesus then dies hoping, but not knowing, if His sacrifice will actually save anyone.
    We all agree! This is a ridiculous scenario! If God’s love requires our permission to be effective, then the Cross was just a rescue offer. The Bible presents the Cross as a decisive victory! Jesus’s death and resurrection was not just a hopeful attempt.

    But maybe this doesn’t convince you. Sure, I agree. After all, the crux of the issue is usually about God’s character. Some people say, *"It wouldn't be fair for God to sovereignly choose one person over another."* But this objection is directly addressed in Romans 9. Furthermore, look at the Old Testament: God literally chose Israel as His people over the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians. This seems to be a very solid point, but you might be thinking… *"Didn't God just foreknow who would be good?"* An astute observation! But this is a different discussion for another time. I think we have already established that 1) The Bible declares God is love, and 2) God often works without necessitating free choice on the recipient's part.

    Regarding predestination: It is abundantly clear that predestination is biblical. God predestines "those he foreknew" to glory (Romans 8/1 Corinthians 2), He predestines us for adoption (Ephesians 1), and He predestined Jesus’s death (Acts 4). The debate is about how He does it (groups vs. individuals), not if He does it. To say "I don't believe in predestination" is to disagree with Scripture itself.

2.  > "I’m not a Calvinist, but I’m not an Arminian either. Don't put me in a box!"

    It’s fine if you don’t know or haven’t decided! It’s not a primary or even a secondary issue. However, to take a hard stance that you are "neither," while claiming great biblical insight, is honestly concerning in my opinion.

    Think about it: Both Classical Arminianism and Calvinism have been scrutinized by brilliant theologians for centuries. They are grounded in historical tradition and the Church Fathers. To claim that you have found both systems "completely unbiblical" implies that you have discovered something that centuries of pastors, scholars, and martyrs missed. C.S. Lewis called this “Chronological Snobbery,” which is the uncritical acceptance of the intellectual climate of our own age and the assumption that whatever has gone obsolete is, on that account, discredited. You are essentially claiming that you, with your modern Bible reading, have more discernment than Augustine, Luther, Edwards, and Wesley combined.

    Now, to be fair, there are other historical "boxes." You might be a Lutheran (who believes in predestination but rejects the "Once Saved Always Saved" logic). You might be a Molinist (who uses philosophy a bit more than Arminians to reconcile God’s sovereignty with free will). You might even be an Amyraldian (a "Four-Point Calvinist"). These are all robust, historical positions.

    But usually, when people say "don't put me in a box," they aren't referencing these sophisticated views. They are usually walking a "middle ground" that is actually a slippery slope toward Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism. This is actually the default setting of American Christianity, largely due to the influence of Charles Finney during the Second Great Awakening. It caters to what the majority of Americans want to hear: the ultimate strength of the individual will. It is worth noting that the early Church condemned these views outright. Chances are, if you aren’t Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Arminian, or Calvinist, you are likely falling into heresy. See more: <https://www.monergism.com/pelagian-captivity-church-0>

## The Difference

Ultimately, the debate comes down to two things: how God works through human decisions, and how God lifts us out of Total Depravity.
Arminians believe Jesus provides Prevenient Grace to everyone, neutralizing the effects of sin enough so that everyone has the ability to freely choose or reject God. On the other hand, Calvinists believe God works directly in the life of the unbeliever, regenerating their heart so that they want to receive Christ’s message. Both sides believe the convert makes a genuine choice to follow Jesus. The question is why they make that choice.

## The Nature of God’s Will

First, let’s look at how God works through human decisions. Arminians believe that God does indeed will things to happen, but they distinguish between His Antecedent Will (God’s desire that no one sins) and His Consequent Will (God’s response to human choices). This distinction is effectively a resolution to the problem of evil: God foreknows the evil act and permits it, but He doesn’t cause it.
Calvinists often object that the "Consequent Will" makes God’s plans contingent on human response, as if God is waiting to see what we do. However, an Arminian can counter this easily: think of God like a master chess player. He isn't "surprised" by a human's move at all. He has already calculated every possible outcome. His plan explicitly accommodates every move a person makes before they make it.
Admittedly, this view is attractive because it seemingly protects God from being responsible for sin. It moves the “contradiction” often attributed to Calvinism up the ladder into a “mystery.”

Consider the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, a great tragedy that shook our nation. Should I have known about this beforehand and had the power to stop it (although not likely since I was 7 at the time), I ought to be held accountable for allowing this tragedy! The Arminian is left with the mystery: Why does God permit humans to cause such tragedies despite being able to stop them? They preserve God’s innocence at the cost of His sovereignty. The Calvinist is left with a different mystery: How does God ordain history, including tragedy, without being the moral author of evil? We preserve God’s sovereignty at the cost of our human comprehension.

I admit it. Philosophically, the Arminian position feels safer and appeases my human intuition on what is right and wrong. If I were hinging my belief solely on philosophy, I might be an Arminian. But I just can’t ignore the instances where the Bible clearly shows God directly intervening in the choices of humans to ensure His specific plans come to pass.
Acts 4:27–28 is perhaps the strongest example. The disciples declare that Herod and Pilate gathered against Jesus "to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur." The greatest injustice in history, the crucifixion, was predestined by God’s hand. Proverbs 21:1 tells us, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will." God doesn’t just watch the king’s heart; He actively turns it. Exodus 4:21 explicitly states, "I will harden his \[Pharaoh's] heart, so that he will not let the people go." God ensured Pharaoh’s stubbornness to fully display His power in the Exodus (as explained in Romans 9). Revelation 17:17 says that "God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose... until the words of God are fulfilled." Ephesians 1:11 declares that God "works all things”—including our decisions—“according to the counsel of his will", not that He works His will around our decisions.
I believe the Bible shows a God who is not afraid to take responsibility for His universe. He ordains the ends (salvation/judgment) and the means (human choices/actions), ensuring that ‘none can stay His hand or say to Him, “What have you done?”’ (Daniel 4:35).

## The Logic of Grace

Secondly, I have to address Prevenient Grace. I really do get why Arminians hold to this. It prevents God from being the deciding factor in who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. This is a difficult doctrine to wrestle with, and I really believe Scripture can be read consistently under both presuppositions. However, there is one logical implication of Prevenient Grace that pushes me away from it: The Glory Problem.

If Prevenient Grace is given to everyone (as Arminians claim), then "Grace" is no longer the reason why one person is saved and another is not.

> Person A receives Prevenient Grace + Decides to Believe = Saved.
>
> Person B receives Prevenient Grace + Decides to Reject = Lost.

In this equation, the only difference between Person A and Person B is human will, not God's grace. This means Person A has a reason to boast! They made the smarter choice! Yet Paul asks in 1 Corinthians 4:7, "For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?"

## Conclusion

Before I wrap up, let’s look at free will. I think we can agree that we act according to our nature. Our character is formed by past experiences and our inherent makeup. We don’t act “out of character” because our character is who we are. When we make a ”free choice,” we are bound by our nature. A lion is “free” to eat salad, but it never will, because its nature dictates it eats meat. Likewise, a sinner is “free” to choose God, but they never will, unless their nature is changed.
Here is the honest question for the Arminian: If you believe God only responds to human action, do you deny God’s work in the specific events that brought you to faith? Did God not arrange the meeting, the church service, the specific sermon, or the friend who shared the Gospel? Do you not think God influenced your sudden willingness to listen?
In what sense are all these events "free choices" completely apart from God making them happen?
It simply comes down to this. I just refuse to deny the work of God in the small events which bring one to follow Jesus. I don’t see how God could sovereignly orchestrate everything that makes us who we are up to that very moment of faith, and then suddenly have nothing to do with the decision itself.
