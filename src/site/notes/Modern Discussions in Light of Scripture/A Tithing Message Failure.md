I offer these reflections as a fellow sinner saved by grace. I am a member, gladly under the shepherding of our leaders, and I have not received seminary training. I’ve tried to study the passages cited and their contexts as carefully as I can, because I want my conscience, and the consciences of my brothers and sisters in Christ, tethered only to what God has actually said. Where I misunderstand, I welcome correction. My aim here is to take Pastor Eric's words seriously, assume the best possible intent, and then test them by Scripture so that our appeals are strong precisely where the Bible is strong (cf. “learn…not to go beyond what is written,” 1 Cor 4:6).

I believe the overarching goal is pastoral and good: to see a church that loves Christ so sincerely that financial generosity becomes planned, cheerful, sacrificial, and transparent. That aim deserves an “amen!” Precisely because the pulpit carries God’s Word to every single member's consciences, the wording matters. Below I quote the statements that troubled me, steelman what Pastor Eric might have meant, and then offer a biblical response. Unless otherwise noted, Bible quotations are ESV and I’ll briefly explain each text’s meaning and context as I cite it.

## 1) “The NT mandates giving above and beyond 10%”

> “**we don’t operate by merely giving the first 10% of our income to the place of our worship and telling ourselves that we’ve done our part. No, we go above and beyond the first 10% in the new Testament era.**”  
> “**When God commanded Israel to bring the first 10% of their income to the place of their worship, they obeyed on the letter of the law…**”

Pastor Eric appears to be guarding against minimalist righteousness, or the instinct to ask, “What is the least that satisfies God?” In that sense, appealing to the cross as the source of generosity is exactly right: grace produces hearts that plan, rejoice, and sacrifice (2 Cor. 8:1–5, ESV). Many believers, moved by Christ’s poverty for our sake, do in fact give well beyond a tenth with gladness (2 Cor. 8:9, ESV).

What the New Testament **does** fix is not a number but a pattern: deliberate, proportionate, conscience-free generosity. When Paul organized famine relief, he instructed every believer in Corinth to set something aside “as he may prosper." In other words, he asked in proportion to God’s provision (1 Cor. 16:2, ESV). When he returned to the same project, he guarded the giver’s interior liberty: “each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion” (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). He further clarified that a gift is “acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have,” a principle that both invites the wealthy to meaningful sacrifice and protects the poor from crushing standards (2 Cor. 8:12, ESV). The church at Antioch modeled the same instinct, determining to send relief “everyone according to his ability” (Acts 11:29, ESV). By contrast, explicit “tithe” language in the New Testament appears in Jesus’s rebukes of Pharisees who remained under Mosaic stipulations (Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:42, ESV); those texts correct hypocrisy, not establish a percentage that Christians should follow.

I think it would serve consciences well for the sermon to celebrate the **wisdom** of using ten percent as a training wheel for newer givers while making crystal clear that the **requirement** of the New Testament is generous, proportionate, cheerful, transparent giving (1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 8:12; 2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). That preserves the commands to those with “abundance” (2 Cor. 8:14, ESV) without binding people's giving where the apostles did not.

Framing “above 10%” as a **New Testament mandate** risks binding consciences beyond Scripture (1 Cor. 4:6, ESV) and functionally **lording it over faith** where the apostles guarded liberty (“not that we lord it over your faith,” 2 Cor. 1:24, ESV; “not under compulsion,” 2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). Such language can push Christians toward **legalism** rather than grace-shaped obedience (Gal. 5:1, ESV), incentivize **performative giving** to meet a metric (cf. Matt. 23:23, ESV), and place **unscriptural burdens** that the apostles explicitly avoided (2 Cor. 8:12–13, ESV). Because teachers will be “**judged with greater strictness**” (James 3:1, ESV), pastoral speech must be precise, refusing “cunning” or Scripture-stretching appeals (2 Cor. 4:2, ESV) and modeling the integrity Paul showed in financial exhortations (2 Cor. 8:20–21, ESV).

## 2) Using 1 Timothy 5:8 to shame non-tithers

> You quoted **1 Timothy 5:8** (“Anyone who does not provide for their relatives… has denied the faith…”) alongside lines like: “**You refuse to take care of your aging parents. You are acting like worse than an animal, guys.**” and applied the verse in a section pressing people to give/tithe.

Right. Pastor Eric rightly wants to rouse sleepy consciences where selfishness has hardened the heart. Scripture speaks bluntly about those who evade basic obligations of love.

This is not it though. In **1 Timothy 5**, Paul is building a **household safety net** so the church can care for “those who are truly widows.” He commands children and grandchildren to “show godliness to their own household” (1 Tim. 5:3–4, ESV) and concludes that anyone who refuses to provide for relatives “has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever” (1 Tim. 5:8, ESV). He then reiterates the purpose: “let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows” (1 Tim. 5:16, ESV). The verse in question, therefore, targets **domestic provision**, not congregational fundraising. In the **same chapter**, Paul also teaches that elders who rule well are worthy of “double honor,” grounding fair support for preaching elders in Scripture: “the laborer deserves his wages” (1 Tim. 5:17–18, ESV).

Recasting a **household** command (1 Tim. 5:4, 8, 16, ESV) as leverage for **church giving** blurs categories and risks **mis-handling the word of truth** (2 Tim. 2:15, ESV). It can unintentionally **displace family obligations** that Scripture prioritizes. Actually, this is precisely the kind of maneuver Jesus rebuked when religious tradition was used to sidestep honoring parents (Mark 7:11–13, ESV). Given the public nature of the pulpit, Pastor Eric’s words should keep the lanes distinct: family provision **and** church support, so that zeal for congregational generosity does not **nullify** what God has clearly assigned to homes (Mark 7:13, ESV).

## 3) Equating non-tithing with doubtful salvation / “worse than an animal”

> “**If you say that you’re saved by the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ, but you refuse to tithe. I just don’t know what that is.**”  
> “**You refuse to take care of your aging parents. You are acting like worse than an animal… Even dogs know how to be loyal…**”

Pastor Eric is right that grace changes wallets. A perpetually closed hand toward evident need contradicts the love God births in the new heart (1 John 3:17–18, ESV). Jesus Himself identifies treasure-paths as disclosures of the heart (Matt. 6:21, ESV).

Yet the New Testament never makes **a percentage** the test of whether Christ has saved a person. The bedrock remains: “by grace … through faith … not a result of works” (Eph. 2:8–9, ESV). Works follow as God’s workmanship: its necessary fruit prepared by the Father (Eph. 2:10, ESV), but they are not criteria that establish or keep someone in the faith. Paul’s longest teaching on money and mercy explicitly rejects coercion even while urging robust generosity: “not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). Likewise, when Zacchaeus resolved radical generousity, Jesus named that generosity as **evidence** of salvation (“Today salvation has come to this house,” Luke 19:8–9, ESV), not its cause.

Making a **percentage** an index of salvation confuses **justification** (by grace through faith) with **sanctification’s fruit** (Eph. 2:8–10, ESV; Gal. 2:16, ESV). This drift can **wound believers** (1 Thess. 5:14, ESV), tempt some to despair, and offer **false assurance** to those who meet the metric without repentance or love (cf. Matt. 7:21–23, ESV). It also risks laying a “**yoke**” God did not place on Gentile consciences (Acts 15:10–11, ESV). The apostolic pattern urges robust generosity while **guarding freedom** (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). On the other hand, pastoral rhetoric, like the one shown, that implies “no giving = no grace” imperils that balance and obscures the gospel’s foundation in Christ’s finished work (Rom. 5:8, ESV). With teachers held to **greater strictness** (James 3:1, ESV), care is needed to keep **assurance** anchored in Christ while pressing **repentant generosity** as evidence, not cause, of new life (Eph. 2:10, ESV).

## 4) “God loves a cheerful giver”—does that mean God **does not love** the un-cheerful?

> “**God loves a cheerful giver. So when it comes to giving, you’re not cheerful. God does not love you.** What don’t you understand about the scripture?”

Pastor Eric is right to insist that God delights in heart-level obedience. Paul’s sentence is clear: “God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). The Father is not indifferent to the spirit in which gifts are brought.

But to infer that God therefore **does not** love struggling saints overstates the text and confuses categories. Scripture speaks of God’s steadfast, initiating love toward sinners: “God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8, ESV); “God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son” (John 3:16, ESV); “not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son” (1 John 4:10, ESV). After all of this, he then anchors unbreakable assurance in that love (“nothing … will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus,” Rom. 8:39, ESV). Within that covenant steadiness, God also has real **pleasures**! He “loves” certain offerings and attitudes in a peculiar way (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV; cf. Heb. 13:16, ESV). The right interpretation, then, is not that God withdraws love from imperfect givers, but that He positively **delights** in and **smiles upon** cheerful participation in mercy.

Announcing that God **does not love** struggling Christians collapses the distinction between God’s **covenant love** and His **particular delight** in cheerful obedience (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). Such a claim can **destabilize assurance** secured by the cross (“while we were still sinners, Christ died for us,” Rom. 5:8, ESV; “nothing… will be able to separate us from the love of God,” Rom. 8:39, ESV), and can provoke **performative cheerfulness** instead of Spirit-wrought sincerity (Heb. 13:16, ESV). Scripture calls pastors to **shepherd… not domineering** but as examples (1 Pet. 5:2–3, ESV), to **speak the truth in love** (Eph. 4:15, ESV), and to **work for the joy** of the flock rather than coercing consciences (2 Cor. 1:24, ESV). Precision here protects bruised reeds (cf. Matt. 12:20, ESV) and keeps the pulpit from overstating Paul’s point about divine **pleasure** into a denial of God’s steadfast **love**.

## 5) “The two earners” illustration and the line, “**That is the New Testament**”

> “**Person A** makes $500k… tithes $50k. **Person B** makes $50k… tithes $5k. Who is hurting more?… **God’s heart** will be most drawn to the second person… Therefore the first person **should give far more than 10%… That is the New Testament.**”

Pastor Eric is asking the affluent be generous. This is precisely Paul’s principle: set aside “as he may prosper” (1 Cor. 16:2, ESV). Paul also appeals to **fairness**: that those with “abundance” supply others’ need (2 Cor. 8:12–15, ESV). Additionally, Jesus praises costly trust as in the widow’s gift (Mark 12:41–44, ESV).

The apostles stop short of a **new percentage law**. They protect freedom of conscience (“not as a command,” 2 Cor. 8:8, ESV; “not under compulsion,” 2 Cor. 9:7, ESV) and insist on proportion and fairness (2 Cor. 8:12–15, ESV). God’s impartiality also cautions against blanket claims about which gift “draws His heart more” (Rom. 2:11, ESV).

Declaring “that is the New Testament” risks creating a de facto **supra-tithe law** (Gal. 5:1, ESV), turning amounts into a scoreboard (Matt. 6:1, ESV), and burdening those Paul sought not to overburden (2 Cor. 8:13, ESV). Comparisons can provoke pride in some, shame in others, and distort motives (2 Cor. 9:7, ESV). Integrity and restraint protect both the flock and the pulpit (2 Cor. 8:20–21, ESV).

## 6) “I want to **compare** your love by **how much you give**”

> “**I want to compare your love… by looking at how much you give.** That’s what Paul is doing… **test people by giving**.”

Pastor Eric is echoing Paul’s desire to “test the sincerity” of love by pointing to earnest examples (2 Cor. 8:8, ESV) and to “stir up one another to love and good works” (Heb. 10:24, ESV).

Paul’s test aims at **genuineness**, not public pecking orders, and he safeguards liberty (“not as a command,” 2 Cor. 8:8, ESV). Jesus forbids almsgiving done to be seen (Matt. 6:1–4, ESV). Amounts alone prove nothing: “If I give away all I have … but have not love, I gain nothing” (1 Cor. 13:3, ESV). The Lord who commended the widow evaluated **heart and cost**, not raw totals (Mark 12:41–44, ESV).

Comparative rhetoric around amounts invites **virtue theater** (Matt. 6:1, ESV), breeds envy or pride, and risks measuring by human measurements: “not wise” (2 Cor. 10:12, ESV). It can hurt the weak and flatter the strong while missing the very quality Paul seeks: **sincere love** guarded by freedom (2 Cor. 8:8–9, ESV). Teachers must avoid cultivating a culture of comparison (James 3:1, ESV).

## 7) Reprising **1 Timothy 5:8** as a pressure text for church giving

> “**He has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Not my words, but the words of God.**”

Pastor Eric wants the sermon to land with gravity. Scripture does speak with solemn weight regarding neglected duties (1 Tim. 5:8, ESV).
  
Once again, the verse belongs to Paul’s **household** policy: children and grandchildren should care for widows so the church can aid “those who are truly widows” (1 Tim. 5:3–4, 16, ESV). In the same context Paul affirms compensating preaching elders (1 Tim. 5:17–18, ESV), but he never deploys verse 8 to compel congregational contributions. Misapplying categories risks mishandling the word (2 Tim. 2:15, ESV).

Peter warns that the unstable “twist” Scriptures to their harm (2 Pet. 3:16, ESV); teachers must rightly divide texts to preserve both household care and congregational generosity (2 Tim. 2:15; James 3:1, ESV).

## 8) The **Macedonians**—use the example the way Paul uses it

> “They gave as much as they were able and **even beyond their ability**… **entirely on their own**… begged for the **privilege** of sharing… ‘**not as a command**’… ‘**test the sincerity of your love**.’”

Pastor Eric is drawing from the richest apostolic case study. The Macedonians, amid “severe test” and “extreme poverty,” gave “of their own accord,” even “beyond their means,” and begged for the grace of participation (2 Cor. 8:1–5, ESV). Paul centers the engine: “though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor” (2 Cor. 8:9, ESV).

Paul pairs inspiration with guardrails: he speaks “not as a command” (2 Cor. 8:8, ESV), affirms **proportion** and **fairness** (“acceptable according to what a person has… not that others should be eased and you burdened,” 2 Cor. 8:12–13, ESV), and insists on **financial integrity** (2 Cor. 8:20–21, ESV). He caps the appeal with freedom and cheer (2 Cor. 9:6–8, ESV).

In my sincere opinion, romanticizing “beyond their means” can valorize **recklessness** that harms households (1 Tim. 5:8, ESV) and ignores Paul’s explicit caveat against overburdening (2 Cor. 8:13, ESV). Constant comparison to the Macedonians can morph into shame-based motivation, undercut freedom (2 Cor. 8:8; 9:7, ESV), and pressure saints without the accompanying safeguards of integrity (2 Cor. 8:20–21, ESV).
