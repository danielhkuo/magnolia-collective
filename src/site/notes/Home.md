# Welcome to the Theology Corner!
This site started out as a general-purpose blog—a place to jot down thoughts and share ideas. But over time, it naturally evolved into something a bit more focused: a collection of (mostly coherent) lecture-rants on all things theology. From deep dives into doctrine to cheat sheets on scripture and church history, it's become a kind of digital notebook for theological exploration. If you are reading this, chances are this space was created with you in mind. Thanks for reading!
