In this blog post, I will explain why Reformed theology does not deny free will.

The Westminster Confession of Faith is the most rigorous standard in the Reformed tradition. It titles its ninth chapter "Of Free Will." It proceeds to affirm that God gave the human will a "natural liberty." According to the Confession, this will is "neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined to good or evil" (WCF 9.1) [^2]. 

The Canons of Dort, another major Reformed document, insist that God's grace "does not treat men as senseless stocks and blocks." It does not take away our will, nor does it do violence to it (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 16) [^3]. 

Francis Turretin was one of the greatest Reformed scholars in history. He went so far as to claim that Calvinists "establish free will far more truly than our opponents" (*Institutes of Elenctic Theology*, X.iii.15) [^4]. These are not throwaway lines. They represent the systematic position of classical Reformed theology. This is a tradition that believed divine sovereignty and genuine human freedom are allies, not enemies.

The popular caricature is simple: Calvinism teaches predestination, therefore Calvinism denies free will. Nearly every internet debate about Reformed theology assumes this is true. For example, popular evangelical resources often contrast God's sovereignty with human choice, asserting that God "could not dictate their innermost feelings, desires, and beliefs" when presenting humanity with a choice (GotQuestions.org) [^1]. However, the actual historical tradition tells a dramatically different story. The early Reformed thinkers spent enormous intellectual energy defining and defending a robust doctrine of human freedom. They did this precisely because they took God's sovereignty so seriously. Understanding what they actually taught requires grasping a few crucial ideas that most modern discussions miss entirely.

## The Confession Literally Has a Chapter Called "Of Free Will"

The Westminster Confession of Faith was completed in 1647 by an assembly of England and Scotland's finest theologians. It addresses human freedom head-on in Chapter 9. Its opening section establishes a principle that governs everything else:

> "God hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty, that is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined to good or evil." (WCF 9.1) [^2]

The Confession then explains human freedom by tracing the will through four distinct states. This framework was originally drawn from St. Augustine and refined over centuries of theological reflection. 

1. **Innocence:** Before the Fall, man had the freedom and power to choose what was pleasing to God. However, he could also choose to lose this condition (WCF 9.2) [^2].
2. **The Fall:** After the Fall, man completely lost the ability to choose spiritual good on his own. He became totally dead in sin (WCF 9.3) [^2].
3. **Grace:** In the state of grace, God frees the believer from the natural bondage of sin. By His grace alone, God enables the person "freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good." Believers still struggle with evil desires, but their will has been set free (WCF 9.4) [^2].
4. **Glory:** In heaven, the human will is made perfectly and immutably free to choose only good (WCF 9.5) [^2].

Notice what the Confession does not say. It does not say the will is destroyed by the Fall. It does not say God's grace bypasses our decision-making. Instead, it says grace actually enables the person freely to will. The will is liberated, not annihilated. 

Look closely at the final state of glory. In heaven, the redeemed can only choose good. Yet, this is not described as a lack of freedom. The Confession calls it being "perfectly and immutably free" (WCF 9.5) [^2]. This reflects a carefully reasoned belief about what freedom actually means.

The Westminster divines were not alone in this thinking. Heinrich Bullinger wrote the Second Helvetic Confession in 1566. His language is vivid. He wrote that after the Fall, man's "reason was not taken from him, nor was he deprived of will, and he was not entirely changed into a stone or a tree" (*Second Helvetic Confession*, Ch. 9) [^5]. The will remains a will. Bullinger drives the point home by saying the fallen will "serves sin, not unwillingly but willingly" (*Second Helvetic Confession*, Ch. 9) [^5]. Sinners are not robots executing a program against their own desires. They do what they want. The problem is that, apart from grace, what they want is sin.

## Doing What You Want: What the Scholastics Meant by "Free"

The key to the entire Reformed position lies in a distinction that most modern Christians completely overlook. It is the difference between "liberty of indifference" and "liberty of spontaneity." 

Francis Turretin framed the question with razor-sharp precision. He asked whether true free will consists of indifference or rational spontaneity. He emphatically denied the former and affirmed the latter (*Institutes*, X.iii.1) [^4].

"Liberty of indifference" is the view that a truly free act requires the ability to have chosen otherwise. This is essentially what philosophers today call libertarian free will. Turretin rejected it categorically (*Institutes*, X.iii.2) [^4]. 

"Liberty of spontaneity," on the other hand, means a free act is one performed voluntarily. It happens without external coercion, and it flows from the person's own rational judgment and desires. On this account, freedom is not about having multiple equal options. Freedom is about acting from your own nature without anyone forcing your hand.

![image 6.webp|Peter Martyr Vermigli, who masterfully defended the doctrine of human freedom alongside divine sovereignty.|482x547](/img/user/0.%20Images/image%206.webp)

Every free act requires two things: a choice made by your reasoning mind, and a willingness to do it without physical compulsion (*Institutes*, X.ii.6) [^4]. Where these two are present, freedom is present. Where either is removed, freedom is destroyed.

This leads to a pivotal point. Turretin argued that not all forms of "necessity" destroy freedom (*Institutes*, X.ii.7–10) [^4]. Being physically forced against your will obviously destroys freedom. Acting from blind animal instinct also destroys freedom. However, acting out of deep moral habits or character does not destroy freedom. The fallen sinner who cannot stop sinning is still free. This is not because alternative options are available, but because the sinning flows directly from the sinner's own corrupt desires. No one is holding a gun to the sinner's head.

Peter Martyr Vermigli made the same case. Even fallen humans, Vermigli argued, retain freedom from coercion. They can exercise genuine judgment in everyday civil matters. The only limitation is directional. The unassisted will simply cannot aim at what is spiritually pleasing to God (*Loci Communes*, II.iii) [^6]. The faculty of the will works fine. It just cannot aim at the right target without God's help.

## Why God in Heaven Proves the Reformed Point

Turretin deployed a single brilliant argument that makes the entire Reformed position click into place. He pointed out that "liberty of indifference" is not found in any free agent that actually exists. It is not even found in God (*Institutes*, X.iii.11) [^4].

If true freedom requires the ability to choose evil, then God Himself would not be free. God cannot choose evil. Furthermore, Christ would not have freely obeyed the Father, because Christ could not sin. The saints in heaven would not freely worship God, because they cannot turn away from Him. 

![image 3.webp|John Owen, the great English Puritan theologian.|284x384](/img/user/0.%20Images/image%203.webp)

This is absurd on its face. God is the freest being in existence, and He is completely incapable of choosing evil. His goodness is necessary, and His freedom is perfect at the exact same time.

If the highest conceivable freedom belongs to a God who cannot choose evil, then the ability to choose evil is not a component of freedom at all. It is a defect. This is why the saints in glory, who can only choose good, are considered perfectly free (WCF 9.5) [^2]. Freedom increases as the will becomes more firmly and joyfully oriented toward the good. It does not increase just because you have more options. 

John Owen, the great English Puritan, summarized the consensus perfectly. He wrote that Reformed believers grant man as much power and liberty as a created being can possibly have. Humans are free to choose, free from outward force, and free to spontaneously embrace whatever seems good to them (*A Display of Arminianism*, Ch. 11) [^7]. As long as you do not make human free will supreme and independent from God, the Reformed tradition is perfectly happy to affirm it.

## God's Control Establishes Freedom

The most philosophically ambitious claim in the Westminster Confession appears in Chapter 3. After affirming that God freely and unchangeably ordains whatsoever comes to pass, the Confession immediately adds a crucial qualification:

> "Yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established." (WCF 3.1) [^2]

That final phrase is explosive. The Confession is not merely saying that God's decree is compatible with human freedom. It is saying that God's decree is the very foundation of human freedom. Divine sovereignty does not compete with human agency. It guarantees it. Without God's sustaining decree, there would be no creatures, no wills, and no choices at all.

![image 4.webp|Samuel Rutherford, a Scottish Covenanter who wrote extensively on how God's grace interacts with human choice.](/img/user/0.%20Images/image%204.webp)

Samuel Rutherford, a Scottish Covenanter, captured this beautifully. He wrote about the friendly association between human liberty and God's eternal decree (*Exercitationes Apologeticae*) [^8]. The infinite Creator does not use His sovereignty to dominate His creatures. Instead, He uses it to guarantee their freedom (*Freedom from Fatalism*) [^9]. Divine sovereignty and human freedom are not locked in a zero-sum competition. 

![image 5.webp|Gisbertus Voetius, the Dutch theologian who developed the concept of 'determination without determinism.'](/img/user/0.%20Images/image%205.webp)

Gisbertus Voetius, a towering Dutch theologian, developed this into what modern scholars call "determination without determinism" (*Gisbertus Voetius on God, Freedom, and Contingency*) [^10]. This is the position that God pre-determines all events without producing the kind of mechanistic, robotic determinism that would destroy genuine human choices. God's ultimate plan operates on a completely different level than human cause-and-effect. It enables our choices to function exactly as they were meant to.

## Neither Arminian Nor Fatalist: The Middle Path

The Canons of Dort reveal how the Reformed tradition rejected two opposite errors at the same time. The Canons describe how God's grace affects the human will. Grace spiritually quickens, heals, and corrects the will. It bends the will "pleasantly and powerfully" (Canons of Dort, III/IV, Art. 16) [^3]. 

That pairing is precise. Grace is powerful because it actually accomplishes conversion. Yet, grace is pleasant because the will is attracted and renewed, not coerced. God's grace is the decisive cause of conversion, but it works through the human will. It changes us from the inside out so that we genuinely and freely believe.

The Heidelberg Catechism approaches this from the angle of human responsibility. Question 9 poses a common objection: Is it unfair for God to require things in His law that man cannot do? 

The answer cuts to the heart of the matter: "No, for God so created man that he was able to do it. But man, at the instigation of the devil, in deliberate disobedience robbed himself and all his descendants of these gifts" (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 9) [^11]. 

Human inability is real, but it is self-inflicted. Humanity's bondage to sin is not a design imposed by God from the outside. It is humanity's own catastrophic choice working its consequences from within.

This is why the early Calvinists fought against fatalism just as hard as they fought against their theological rivals (*Institutes*, X.ii.5) [^4]. They wanted to make it incredibly clear that God is fully sovereign, but humans are also making real, responsible choices.

## Conclusion: Freedom Rightly Understood

The Reformed tradition offers something much better than the caricature of a divine puppet master. It also offers something more biblical than the idea of an uncaused, completely independent human will. 

It offers a vision of freedom rooted in who you are, rather than merely what options lie before you. You are free when you act from your own nature, your own desires, and your own rational judgment, without anyone forcing you against your will. 

A God who necessarily loves goodness is the freest being imaginable. A saint in heaven who can only choose worship is more free than a sinner paralyzed by competing worldly desires. Furthermore, a sinner who cannot stop sinning is still morally responsible, because the sin flows from the sinner's own willing heart.

This is not a minor footnote in Reformed theology. It is written into the confessions and defended by the greatest minds of the historical church. True freedom is a joyful willingness to do good rather than anxious indecision. It is grounded in God's sovereign plan. Ultimately, this is the only freedom worth having, and it is the only freedom that actually exists.
