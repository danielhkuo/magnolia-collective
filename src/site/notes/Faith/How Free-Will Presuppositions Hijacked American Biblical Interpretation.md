**In this blog post, I argue that the American evangelical default, reading Scripture through the lens of libertarian free will, is not a discovery from the text but a cultural inheritance.** A convergence of Jacksonian democracy, frontier individualism, the Second Great Awakening's decisionist revivalism, and consumer capitalism created an environment where human autonomy became the unquestioned hermeneutical starting point for millions of Bible readers. The tragic result is a systematic misreading of passages about human choice, divine sovereignty, and God's salvific will. This was not, I want to be clear, the position of historical Protestantism: the Reformers, the Puritans, and the broader confessional Protestant tradition held robustly to divine sovereignty and human inability as the framework within which human response is understood. Finney, the camp meeting, and the revivalist movements of the nineteenth century represented a decisive break from that inherited consensus. I have organized this around five interlocking areas, with specific citations and URLs throughout to show that I'm not just making this up.

## 1. Ten key verses commonly read through a free-will hermeneutic

I chose to include this section because it shows that there exist passages that require careful reading. It does, at times, seem that these verses have to be interpreted as "human agency over God's will". I disagree. I will later show that we, as Americans, have intrinsic presuppositions that we might not be seeing as we read these texts. For now, as we look at these, we must try our best to view the passages from both sides. Firstly, the popular evangelical hermeneutic. This is a logical chain: if God commands a choice, FIRSTLY humans must possess the autonomous ability to make that choice ("ought-implies-can); if Scripture uses universal language ("all," "world," "whoever"), it must mean every individual without exception; and if God expresses desire for human repentance, that desire must be frustrated only by human free will. On the other hand, the historical Protestant hermeneutic — the position held by Luther, Calvin, the Puritans, and the confessional Protestant tradition broadly, insists on **distinguishing between _duty_ and _ability_** (distinguishing what we *ought to do* and what we *can do*), reading universal language within its grammatical and covenantal context, and grounding all human response in prior divine initiative.

**Joshua 24:15 ("Choose this day whom you will serve")** is perhaps the single most popular free-will proof-text in American evangelicalism, appearing on wall art, bumper stickers, and evangelistic tracts. GotQuestions.org explains that Joshua "offers them a choice" and "could not dictate their innermost feelings, desires, and beliefs" [^1]. In particular, the Reformed reading notes three critical contextual facts that the popular reading just completely ignores. First, this is a covenant renewal ceremony among God's _already-redeemed_ people, not an evangelistic altar call. Second, it's pretty clear that **Joshua 24:19 immediately adds "You cannot serve the LORD,"** highlighting human inability. Third and finally, Crossway's commentary observes that Israel stands "in the sovereign grace of God, their covenant Lord who has done all to bring them to this momentous place," referencing Ezekiel 36:26 and Jeremiah 31:31-34 on God giving a new heart as the basis for obedient choosing [^2].

**Deuteronomy 30:19 ("I have set before you life and death… choose life")** follows the same pattern. GotQuestions reads it as proof that "people have a choice, a decision to make" and "we choose life when we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior" [^3]. The traditional interpretation distinguishes between the _duty_ of man (to choose life) and the _ability_ of man (bound by sin, per Romans 8:7-8). Critically, **Deuteronomy 29:4**, just one chapter earlier, says "But to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to understand," showing the context itself acknowledges human inability apart from divine enablement. Again, this is an example of the "ought-implies-can" mantra weaponized in hermeneutics.

**John 3:16 ("For God so loved the world")** is read by popular sources as an open, universal invitation requiring only a human decision. GotQuestions explains that "whoever believes in Him" implies "an open, non-restricted offer" and that "the world" means "all of mankind" [^4]. This most certainly doesn't read the verse in context. John Piper counters by noting the immediate context: "verse 8 says that God the Spirit blows where he wills and makes alive whom he chooses," so that "it is he, and not we, who has the final, decisive say in who among the spiritually rebellious and dead will be raised to new life" [^5]. "Whoever believes" describes the _certain result_ for all who believe, but "who gives the faith to believe?" is answered by John 6:44, Ephesians 2:8-9, and Philippians 1:29.

**Revelation 3:20 ("Behold, I stand at the door and knock")** may be the most iconically misused verse. Even GotQuestions acknowledges that this is "often used as an illustration of Jesus' offer of salvation to individuals," but corrects: "Jesus is not pleading with an individual to be saved; He's seeking admittance to a church" [^6]. Combined with Holman Hunt's famous painting (no handle on the outside), this verse functions as the paradigmatic image of Jesus as a gentleman who won't force entry. R.C. Sproul frequently identified this as one of the most misused verses in evangelicalism, ripped from its ecclesiastical context and applied to individual soteriology.

**2 Peter 3:9 ("not willing that any should perish")** is a primary Arminian pillar text. R.C. Sproul delivers the decisive rebuttal from the Reformed school of thought: "If we take the blanket statement, 'God is not willing that any should perish,' and apply the sovereign efficacious will to it, the conclusion is obvious. **No one will perish.** If God sovereignly decrees that no one should perish, and God is God, then certainly no one will ever perish. This would be a proof text not for Arminianism but for universalism. The text would then prove too much for Arminians." Sproul notes the pronouns: the "us" in 2 Peter 3:9 ("the Lord is longsuffering toward _us_") refers to Peter's audience, namely the elect, the "beloved" [^7]. James White concurs: "2 Peter 3:9 notes that God is not willing that _his people_ perish" [^8].

**1 Timothy 2:4 ("who desires all people to be saved")** receives two main Reformed treatments. The Calvin/Owen/Sproul/White line reads "all" as "all sorts of men," noting the context of 1 Timothy 2:1-2 instructs prayer "for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions," so the "all" in verse 4 means all _kinds_ of people, including rulers, not every individual head for head. Piper takes a different route, affirming God genuinely desires all to be saved in one sense but that "his supreme commitment to uphold and display the full range of his glory through the sovereign demonstration of his wrath and mercy" takes priority in what is known as the "two wills" framework [^9].

**Ezekiel 18:23 ("Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?"), John 7:17, Romans 10:9-10, and Acts 2:21** all follow similar patterns. The popular reading treats each as proof of human autonomous agency. Again, looking at the Reformed reading grounds, each verse in prior divine initiative. Acts 2:21 is particularly instructive because it quotes Joel 2:32, whose full text reads: "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved… and **among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls**." The verse itself teaches dual calling, meaning humans call on God, grounded in God's first calling of them. Peter confirms this pattern at Acts 2:39: "the promise is for… **everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself**."

## 2. Charles Finney systematically rewired American hermeneutics

This is the big one that I've been trying to explain for the longest time. No single figure did more to embed free-will presuppositions into the bloodstream of American evangelicalism than **Charles Grandison Finney (1792-1875)**. Michael Horton's assessment is harsh but true: "No single man is more responsible for the distortion of Christian truth in our age than Charles Grandison Finney" [^10]. Understanding Finney is essential because his hermeneutical method, assuming human moral ability as a starting presupposition and then reading Scripture through that lens, became the default approach of American popular theology.

### Finney's core doctrinal departures

Finney's _Systematic Theology_ (1846/1878) rejected virtually every doctrine the Reformation recovered. On **original sin**, he was explicit: "Original sin, physical regeneration, and all their kindred and resulting dogmas, are alike subversive of the gospel, and repulsive to the human intelligence" (_Systematic Theology_, p. 236; cited in Horton [^10]). He called inherited depravity/original sin an "anti-scriptural and nonsensical dogma" (p. 179, Bethany 1976 edition). Jay E. Smith's analysis in _Trinity Journal_ 13NS (1992) confirms: "For Finney, moral depravity consists in voluntary sinning with absolutely no direct connection to Adam or his sin" [^11].

On **substitutionary atonement**, Finney rejected imputation entirely: "The doctrine of imputed righteousness, or that Christ's obedience to the law was accounted as our obedience, is founded on a most false and nonsensical assumption." Christ's righteousness "could do no more than justify himself. It can never be imputed to us" (_Systematic Theology_, pp. 320-322). On **justification by faith alone**, Finney taught that "the Christian is justified no longer than he obeys, and must be condemned when he disobeys" (p. 46), and that "perseverance in obedience to the end of life is also a condition of justification" (pp. 326-327). He declared the Reformation doctrine of _simul justus et peccator_ (simultaneously justified and sinner) to be an error that "has slain more souls, I fear, than all the Universalism that ever cursed the world" (p. 60).

### The hermeneutical method behind the departures

Finney's own preface to his _Systematic Theology_ reveals his fundamental hermeneutical move. He wrote: "I could not but perceive that the true idea of moral government had no place in the theology of the church… The doctrines of a nature, sinful per se, of a necessitated will, of inability, and of physical regeneration… embarrassed and even confounded me at every step. I often said to myself, **'If these things are really taught in the Bible, I must be an infidel.'** But the more I read my Bible, the more clearly I saw that these things were not found there upon any fair principles of interpretation, such as would be admitted in a court of justice" [^12].

This passage is hermeneutically revealing. Finney applied legal/courtroom standards of interpretation to Scripture and treated human moral ability as axiomatic. If a doctrine (like original sin or inability) seemed unreasonable by those standards, it could not be what Scripture teaches. As the _Master's Seminary Journal_ notes: "Finney's emphasis upon 'the philosophy or the workings of my own mind as they were revealed in consciousness' in his hermeneutic allowed him to modify Old School positions in order to maximize his evangelistic appeal" [^13].

### Reformed assessments are unanimous and devastating

**B.B. Warfield** devoted an extensive chapter to Finney in _Studies in Perfectionism_ (1931-32), concluding: "It is quite clear that what Finney gives us is less a theology than a system of morals. **God might be eliminated from it entirely without essentially changing its character**" [^14]. Warfield described Finney's system as one where "the initiative belongs to man; everywhere and always God's action is suspended upon man's will."

**R.C. Sproul** was even more direct: "He rejected not only Augustinianism, but he also rejected semi-Pelagianism and stood clearly on the subject of unvarnished Pelagianism, saying in no uncertain terms, without any ambiguity, that there was no Fall and that there is no such thing as original sin. This man went on to attack viciously the doctrine of the substitutionary atonement of Christ, and in addition to that, to repudiate as clearly and as loudly as he could the doctrine of justification by faith alone" [^15]. Sproul added: **"He is the patron saint of twentieth-century Evangelicalism. And he is not semi-Pelagian; he is unvarnished in his Pelagianism."** [^15] W. Robert Godfrey confirmed: "There has never been a theologian in the history of the Christian church more consistently Pelagian, not semi-Pelagian, but Pelagian as Finney himself" [^16].

### The trickle-down effect from Finney to the modern pew

Finney's most consequential innovation was methodological, not doctrinal. His _Lectures on Revivals of Religion_ (1835) contains the foundational claim: "A revival is not a miracle, nor dependent on a miracle, in any sense. It is a purely philosophical result of the right use of the constituted means, as much so as any other effect produced by the application of means" (pp. 4-5). He declared it "dangerous" to believe revival depends on divine activity.

This produced the **"anxious bench"** (precursor to the modern altar call), which Finney explicitly compared to baptism's role in the apostolic church [^17]. The methodology evolved through a direct lineage: **Finney to D.L. Moody** (adapted into the "Inquiry Room") to **Billy Sunday** (the "sawdust trail") to **Billy Graham** (refined with trained counselors and music) to **Bill Bright's "Four Spiritual Laws"** (late 1950s). Graham himself praised Finney: "Few men have had such a profound impact on their generation" (Foreword to Lewis Drummond's _The Life and Ministry of Charles G. Finney_, 1983). Cameron Buettel of Grace to You traces the seeker-sensitive movement directly to Finney: "Finney's fingerprints are all over modern seeker-sensitive strategies… those who pioneered the seeker-sensitive megachurch juggernaut in America were practical Pelagians" [^18].

The net result is that Finney's hermeneutical assumption, which asserts that human moral ability is the interpretive starting point, became the invisible default of American evangelical Bible reading, even among churches that would never consciously endorse Pelagianism.

## 3. "Love requires freedom": a philosophical axiom masquerading as biblical truth

This is one I hear a lot. The claim that love requires libertarian free will, meaning genuine love is impossible unless the lover has the metaphysical ability to do otherwise, has become perhaps the most widespread theological assumption in American popular Christianity. This is genuinely one of my biggest peeves. **This slogan does not appear anywhere in Scripture.** As GotQuestions.org itself acknowledges in one notable article: "The 'standard' answer seems to be that, for love to be real, it must not be coerced… **The problem with this line of thinking is that, although it may be somewhat satisfying intellectually, it is never articulated in Scripture**" [^19]. This is a striking admission from the very site that elsewhere functionally assumes the principle.

### C.S. Lewis provided the popular formulation

The claim's dominance in popular Christianity traces primarily to, surprisingly, **C.S. Lewis**. In _Mere Christianity_ (1952), Lewis wrote: "Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata, which consists of creatures that worked like machines, would hardly be worth creating." In _The Problem of Pain_ (1940), he argued that God _cannot_ create free creatures and simultaneously withhold free will from them, treating this as a logical impossibility. His concept in _The Great Divorce_ (1945) that "the doors of hell are locked from the inside," emphasizing humans freely choosing separation from God, became the default evangelical explanation for hell. As much as I like C.S. Lewis, he was not a systematic theologian by any means. As one reviewer noted, "In the times when he talks about 'free will,' it isn't necessary. All that is necessary is moral responsibility, not this idea of free will" [^20].

### Philosophical systematization through Plantinga and Craig

**Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense** (finalized in _God, Freedom, and Evil_, 1977) gave the claim rigorous philosophical form: "To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, he must create creatures capable of moral evil; and he cannot leave these creatures free to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so" (pp. 166-167) [^21]. Plantinga explicitly defines freedom in libertarian terms: "no antecedent conditions and/or causal laws determine that he will perform the action." Critics note this presupposes libertarian incompatibilist free will, and the careful philosophical distinction that Plantinga's defense (he's a Calvinist by the way) shows mere logical _possibility_, not God's actual reasons, has been **widely lost** in popular theology, where the defense is treated as revealing God's actual motivation.

**William Lane Craig** systematized the claim within Molinism: "Once you are causally determined by factors outside yourself to do what you do, then it seems to me that in no significant sense are these actions up to you. And therefore moral praise and blame, for example, would become impossible" [^22]. Craig explicitly connects libertarian freedom to the possibility of genuine love and moral responsibility.

### My Rebuttal

**First, the Trinitarian argument.** The love within the Trinity, between Father, Son, and Spirit, is the highest, most perfect form of love in existence. Yet this love is **necessary**, not contingent. The Father _necessarily_ loves the Son; neither has the "ability to do otherwise." If "love requires libertarian freedom" were true, then God's own intra-Trinitarian love would not be genuine love, an absurd conclusion. Greg Koukl (Stand to Reason) makes this point directly: "It doesn't seem that God has the freedom NOT to love, because goodness, and therefore love, is essential to His nature. And if love requires freedom, then God doesn't truly love" [^23].

**Second, the Christological argument.** Jonathan Edwards, followed by Calvin and Turretin, argued that **Jesus could not have sinned** (the impeccability of Christ), yet His perfect obedience and love were genuinely virtuous and praiseworthy. As documented in The Gospel Coalition's _Themelios_: "In order to show that liberty of indifference was not necessary for moral responsibility, Jonathan Edwards argued that Jesus's actions were necessary, and yet, they were morally praiseworthy" [^24]. If the most virtuous being who ever lived could not have done otherwise, libertarian freedom is demonstrably unnecessary for genuine love.

**Third, Edwards's _Freedom of the Will_ (1754)**, which Sproul called "the most important theological work ever published in America," argued that the will always acts according to its strongest inclination. This is **compatible with genuine love** because the person does what they most want to do. The historical Protestant position holds that freedom is not the metaphysical ability to do otherwise but the ability to act according to one's nature without external coercion. Fallen humans freely choose sin because their nature is enslaved; regenerated humans freely love God because God has changed their nature. Thaddeus Williams's academic monograph _Love, Freedom, and Evil: Does Authentic Love Require Free Will?_ (Rodopi, 2011) provides the fullest treatment, "masterfully dismantling this argument with biblical compatibilism" [^25].

## 4. The cultural ecosystem that made free will feel "obvious"

The free-will hermeneutic did not emerge from careful exegesis. It was cultivated by a constellation of cultural forces that made libertarian autonomy feel self-evidently true to American Christians, so obvious it didn't need to be argued for, only assumed.

### Jacksonian democracy made election feel un-American

Nathan Hatch's landmark _The Democratization of American Christianity_ (Yale, 1989) demonstrates that the populist movements of the early republic (1790s-1840s) fundamentally reshaped theology. Hatch documents how five mass movements (the Christian movement, Methodists, Baptists, Black churches, and Mormons) "offered compelling visions of individual potential and collective aspiration to the unschooled and unsophisticated." These movements were "opposed to 'priestcraft' and to the passivity they believed was instilled by Calvinist theology" and "believed that they could make salvation available directly to the ordinary individual in the marketplace of ideas." Hatch's book includes an appendix titled "A sampling of anticlerical and anti-Calvinist Christian verse," illustrating how populist movements specifically targeted doctrines of election as **spiritual aristocracy** incompatible with democratic principles [^26].

The Jacksonian era's egalitarianism made the Calvinist idea of God electing some and not others seem politically repugnant. As Scott Aniol observes: "Americans became known for a kind of 'rugged individualism' and distrust of systems of authority or anything that resembled class distinctions. Individuals expected to have a say in how they lived and what they believed" [^27].

### The Second Great Awakening completed the theological revolution

The contrast between the two Great Awakenings crystallizes the transformation as sharply as anything in American religious history. As _Desiring God_ summarizes: "The evangelical faith of the First Great Awakening in America was almost uniformly Calvinist. That of the Second Great Awakening was a mix of Calvinist and Arminian convictions. If Jonathan Edwards's theology was representative of the First Great Awakening, John Wesley's was more typical of the Second" [^30]. The _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ confirms: "During the Second Great Awakening revivalistic theology in many denominations shifted from Calvinism to a practical Arminianism as preachers emphasized the ability of sinners to make an immediate decision for their salvation" [^31].

The EBSCO Research overview captures the synthesis: "Methodist acceptance of the doctrine that individuals have free will to attain salvation was in accord with a general shift of theological emphasis within American Protestantism in the early nineteenth century… **by the Jacksonian period the message of free will seemed to many the spiritual counterpart of suffrage and laissez-faire**" [^32]. Camp meetings reinforced the shift. Britannica notes that "the emphasis on a sudden conversion experience tended to reduce doctrinal preaching to a minimum, break down the old creedal standards, and undermine the concept of a learned pastoral ministry" [^33].

What made the Second Great Awakening decisive, however, was not merely a change in theological opinion but the creation of entirely new **institutional structures that embedded free-will assumptions into the operating system of American Protestantism**. Take for instance the camp meeting, pioneered on the Kentucky frontier at Cane Ridge in 1801 under Barton W. Stone (drawing an estimated ten to twenty thousand participants over several days). That was no simple gathering for worship, it was a technology for producing mass conversion events understood as individual decisions. The emotional intensity of the camp meeting was designed to bring people to a moment of conscious choice, and "success" was measured by the number of visible responses. The theology had to match the method: if the method assumed people could and must decide, the theology had to insist they possessed the ability to do so.

The denominational consequences were rapid and lasting. **Baptist churches**, which in the New England and mid-Atlantic colonies had been dominated by Particular (Calvinist) theology since the Philadelphia Baptist Association (1707) and the Second London Confession (1689), saw a decisive demographic shift on the frontier toward General Baptist and Arminian convictions. Methodism, already Arminian in its Wesleyan origins, surged to become the largest Protestant denomination in America by 1850, spreading its conviction of free will and resistible grace through an unmatched circuit rider network. **Presbyterians experienced a major schism in 1837**, with the "Old School" (emphasizing strict subscription to the Westminster Confession and opposing the Plan of Union with Congregationalists) and the "New School" (more open to revivalist methodology and less rigid on confessional subscription) dividing over a tangle of theological, organizational, and regional concerns. This split deserves careful framing: the New School was not simply Arminian. Most remained within the Edwardsian Calvinist tradition, and there was considerable theological diversity among them. Finney himself was a Presbyterian minister and his "New Measures" became a flashpoint, but he represented an extreme end of a wide spectrum, and many New School Presbyterians would have rejected his more radical theological conclusions.

The deeper hermeneutical consequence was a fundamental **redefinition of what conversion is**. Prior to the Second Great Awakening, the dominant model of conversion in Reformed and Puritan communities was not an instantaneous decision but an extended process of examination: testing one's heart, waiting on the Spirit, discerning the marks of grace. Jonathan Edwards's _Religious Affections_ (1746) was precisely this kind of careful, cautious engagement with the question of authentic conversion. The Second Great Awakening replaced this model with what historians call **"decisionism"**: conversion as a datable, volitional event where the individual exercises the ability to choose Christ. This restructuring meant that the entire theological apparatus supporting sovereign grace (inability, effectual calling, and irresistible grace) became not merely theologically disputed but increasingly sidelined in practice. If conversion is a decision, the preacher's job is to maximize the conditions for that decision, not to proclaim a gospel that waits on the Holy Spirit's sovereign work. Detailed doctrinal instruction increasingly gave way to immediate appeals for response.

The institutional legacy cemented these assumptions across generations. Sunday school curricula, tract societies, and the great voluntary associations of the antebellum period (the American Bible Society, the American Tract Society, the American Home Missionary Society) were all built on a free-will evangelistic model. They produced millions of pamphlets, tracts, and catechisms framing salvation as a choice available to all who would exercise it. By the time Finney systematized this theology in his _Systematic Theology_ (1846), he was not innovating so much as codifying what the Second Great Awakening had already established as the default American Protestant approach. **The Awakening created the market; Finney gave it its most rigorous and theologically consequential rationale.** This is why Finney cannot be understood in isolation: he was the culmination and theologian of a movement that had already reshaped American Christianity from the ground up.

### Consumer culture made salvation a product to choose

David Wells's _No Place for Truth_ (Eerdmans, 1993) documents how consumer capitalism colonized the church: "The churches, in larger and larger numbers, are adapting themselves to felt needs in the congregations much as a business might adapt its product to a market. In other words, the Church is sanctioning the idea that when someone comes in its doors it's okay to view that person as a consumer." James K.A. Smith's _Desiring the Kingdom_ (Baker Academic, 2009) argues that "secular liturgies" like the mall, the stadium, and the market form desires that compete with Christian formation. He warns that evangelical worship often trains "people to be more like individual consumers or spectators than like a community of Christ followers" [^34]. Roger Finke and Rodney Stark's _The Churching of America_ (Rutgers, 1992) explicitly models American religion as a "free market economy where churches compete for souls," a framework that itself presupposes and reinforces free-will theological assumptions.

The ubiquitous evangelical language of "accepting Jesus," "making a decision for Christ," and "inviting Jesus into your heart" reflects both Finney's decision theology and consumer-choice culture. Salvation is framed as a transaction where the individual is the sovereign agent selecting a product.

## 5. GotQuestions.org as the default American hermeneutic

GotQuestions.org receives approximately **17.79 million visits per month** (Semrush, March 2025), with over **2.5 billion cumulative pageviews** and content in **185 languages**. It reaches roughly **three to four times** more people than DesiringGod.org (~4.6 million monthly visits). With 52.69% of traffic from organic Google search, its articles appear at or near the top of search results for virtually any Bible question. This makes GotQuestions the single most influential theological resource for average English-speaking Christians, and its hermeneutical framing shapes how millions read the Bible.

### Five recurring hermeneutical patterns

**Pattern 1: The "mystery" framework.** Nearly every sovereignty-related article opens with a variation of "it is impossible for us to fully understand the dynamics of a holy God molding and shaping the will of man" [^35]. The Calvinism-vs.-Arminianism article concludes: "both systems fail in that they attempt to explain the unexplainable" [^36]. The founder, S. Michael Houdmann, self-identifies as a "Calminian" who "essentially gave up trying to fully understand" [^37]. This "mystery" framing effectively neutralizes the question rather than resolving it exegetically.

**Pattern 2: "Both extremes are wrong."** GotQuestions consistently frames sovereignty and free will as two poles: "Some emphasize the sovereignty of God to the point that human beings are little more than robots… Others emphasize free will to the point of God not having complete control… **Neither of these positions is biblical**" [^35]. This false equivalence treats divine sovereignty, an attribute of God's nature, as equivalent in theological weight to human free will, which is a debated anthropological claim.

**Pattern 3: "God will not force/coerce."** The phrase "He will not force anyone to come to Him" or its equivalent appears across multiple articles. BibleStudyTools is more explicit: "As much as he loves mankind, he will not override man's will" [^38]. Christianity.com states: "When God first created man, He established free will" [^39].

**Pattern 4: Universal texts read at face value.** 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9 are consistently cited as teaching God's desire to save every individual, with human free will as the sole limiting factor. GotQuestions writes: "He desires that all would be saved and come to repentance (1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9). He offers salvation to everyone (Titus 2:11) yet He will not force anyone to come to Him" [^40].

**Pattern 5: Sovereignty redefined to include permission.** GotQuestions states: "The right of God to _allow_ mankind's free choices is just as necessary for true sovereignty as His ability to enact His will" [^41]. This subtly redefines sovereignty from God's active decree over all things to God's _permission_ of autonomous human choices, **a move that makes sovereignty derivative of and limited by free will.**

### The contrast with Reformed sites is stark

Ligonier Ministries (R.C. Sproul) explicitly rejects the symmetry: "When we talk about God's sovereignty and human free agency, **we're not talking about apples and apples.** The sovereignty of an omnipotent God is different than a free agency choice that a human makes. It's not bringing together two equal things. He is sovereign. We are responsible. He is _ultimately_ sovereign over all things. We are _penultimately_ responsible" [^42]. Desiring God insists: "The new birth brings about faith. Faith is, therefore, not the result of human self-determination but of the new birth" [^43]. Where popular sites treat sovereignty and free will as co-equal mysteries, Reformed sites insist on asymmetry: God's sovereignty is primary and enabling, while human responsibility is real but derivative and subordinate.

## Conclusion: the corrective starts with divine nature, not human capacity

The research reveals a consistent pattern: **the free-will hermeneutic begins with an anthropological assumption (humans possess libertarian free will) and reads Scripture to confirm it**, while the historical Protestant hermeneutic begins with theology proper (God's sovereignty, omniscience, aseity, immutability) and reads human agency in light of it. This was the consensus position of the Reformation and its heirs (Luther, Calvin, the Westminster divines, the Puritans, the confessional Baptist tradition) long before "Calvinist" became a sectarian label and "Reformed" became one option among many. The free-will starting point was not discovered in Scripture but was culturally constructed through Jacksonian democracy (making election seem elitist), the Second Great Awakening (transforming conversion into a decisionist event and structurally encoding free-will assumptions into American evangelical institutions), Finney's systematic theological rationale for that movement, and consumer capitalism (making salvation a personal choice in a spiritual marketplace).

The corrective this essay argues for, which grounds interpretation in what Scripture clearly teaches about God's nature and lets those conclusions govern ambiguous passages about human choice, has strong exegetical and historical warrant. The "two wills" framework (Piper), the duty-vs.-ability distinction (the broader Protestant tradition), the Trinitarian and Christological arguments against "love requires freedom," and the contextual reading of universal-sounding texts all demonstrate that Scripture, read on its own terms, presents a God whose sovereignty is not in tension with human responsibility but is its enabling ground. The popular evangelical hermeneutic, for all its democratic appeal, gets the order backwards, and the cost is a diminished God and an inflated human agent at the center of the biblical story.
