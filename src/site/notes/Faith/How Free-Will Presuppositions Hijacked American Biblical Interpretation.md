**In this blog post, I argue that the American evangelical default, reading Scripture through the lens of libertarian free will, is not a discovery from the text but a cultural inheritance.** A hermeneutical presupposition is an assumption you carry into a text before you read it, one so deeply embedded that it feels like "just what the verse plainly says" rather than a filter you are reading through. The free-will presupposition is precisely this: the conviction that human beings possess the autonomous ability to choose or reject God, which then determines in advance what any biblical command, invitation, or universal statement can possibly mean. A convergence of Jacksonian democracy, frontier individualism, the Second Great Awakening's decisionist revivalism, and consumer capitalism created an environment where human autonomy became the unquestioned hermeneutical starting point for millions of Bible readers. The tragic result is a systematic misreading of passages about human choice, divine sovereignty, and God's salvific will. This was not, I want to be clear, the position of historical Protestantism: the Reformers, the Puritans, and the broader confessional Protestant tradition held robustly to divine sovereignty and human inability as the framework within which human response is understood. Finney, the camp meeting, and the revivalist movements of the nineteenth century represented a decisive break from that inherited consensus. I have organized this around five sections, with specific citations and URLs throughout to show that I am not just making this up.

## 1. Ten key verses commonly read through a free-will hermeneutic

I chose to include this section because it shows that there exist passages that require careful reading. It does, at times, seem that these verses have to be interpreted as "human agency over God's will." I disagree. I will later show that we, as Americans, have intrinsic presuppositions that we might not be seeing as we read these texts. For now, as we look at these, we must try our best to view the passages from both sides. Firstly, the popular evangelical hermeneutic. This is a logical chain: if God commands a choice, humans must possess the autonomous ability to make that choice ("ought implies can"); if Scripture uses universal language ("all," "world," "whoever"), it must mean every individual without exception; and if God expresses desire for human repentance, that desire must be frustrated only by human free will.

A brief word on "ought implies can," because it is the single most important presupposition this blog is targeting. The principle means: if you are morally obligated to do something, you must already be capable of doing it. Applied to the Bible: if God commands "repent," you must be able to repent; if God says "believe," you must be able to believe. It feels so obviously correct that most readers never notice they are using it. Charles Hodge identified it as the "radical principle of the Pelagian theory": "ability limits obligation -- 'If I ought, I can,' is the aphorism on which the whole system rests" [^60]. The Reformers argued it is precisely backwards: God's commands reveal duty, not ability. Luther put it in the most memorable possible way in _De Servo Arbitrio_ (1525): "Even grammarians and schoolboys on street corners know that nothing more is signified by verbs in the imperative mood than what ought to be done, and that what is done or can be done should be expressed by words in the indicative. How is it that you theologians are twice as stupid as schoolboys, in that as soon as you get hold of a single imperative verb you infer an indicative meaning, as though the moment a thing is commanded it is done, or can be done?" [^54] On this reading, God's commands exist to expose what we cannot do without grace, not to confirm what we can do on our own.

On the other hand, the historical Protestant hermeneutic (the position held by Luther, Calvin, the Puritans, and the confessional Protestant tradition broadly) insists on **distinguishing between _duty_ and _ability_** (what we *ought to do* and what we *can do*), reading universal language within its grammatical and covenantal context, and grounding all human response in prior divine initiative.

I also want to point out this was not a Reformed/Calvinist innovation. Luther established this framework in _De Servo Arbitrio_ (1525) against Erasmus, the Augsburg Confession (1530) Article XVIII codified it for Lutheran churches, and the Anglican Thirty-Nine Articles (1571) Article X articulated it for the Church of England [^44][^45][^46].

**Joshua 24:15 ("Choose this day whom you will serve")** is perhaps the single most popular free-will proof-text in American evangelicalism, appearing on wall art, bumper stickers, and evangelistic tracts. GotQuestions.org explains that Joshua "offers them a choice" and "could not dictate their innermost feelings, desires, and beliefs" [^1]. In particular, the historical Protestant reading notes three critical contextual facts that the popular reading just completely ignores. First, this is a covenant renewal ceremony among God's _already-redeemed_ people, not an evangelistic altar call. Second, **Joshua 24:19 immediately adds "You cannot serve the LORD,"** highlighting human inability. Third and finally, Crossway's commentary observes that Israel stands "in the sovereign grace of God, their covenant Lord who has done all to bring them to this momentous place," referencing Ezekiel 36:26 and Jeremiah 31:31-34 on God giving a new heart as the basis for obedient choosing [^2].

**Deuteronomy 30:19 ("I have set before you life and death… choose life")** follows the same pattern. GotQuestions reads it as proof that "people have a choice, a decision to make" and "we choose life when we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior" [^3]. The traditional interpretation distinguishes between the _duty_ of man (to choose life) and the _ability_ of man (bound by sin, per Romans 8:7-8). Critically, **Deuteronomy 29:4**, just one chapter earlier, says "But to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to understand," showing the context itself acknowledges human inability apart from divine enablement. This is "ought implies can" applied as a hermeneutic: the text gets read backward, as if the presence of a command settles the question of capacity.

**John 3:16 ("For God so loved the world")** is read by popular sources as an open, universal invitation requiring only a human decision. GotQuestions explains that "whoever believes in Him" implies "an open, non-restricted offer" and that "the world" means "all of mankind" [^4]. John Piper counters by noting the immediate context: "verse 8 says that God the Spirit blows where he wills and makes alive whom he chooses," so that "it is he, and not we, who has the final, decisive say in who among the spiritually rebellious and dead will be raised to new life" [^5]. "Whoever believes" describes the _certain result_ for all who believe, but "who gives the faith to believe?" is answered by John 6:44, Ephesians 2:8-9, and Philippians 1:29.

**Revelation 3:20 ("Behold, I stand at the door and knock")** may be the most iconically misused verse. Even GotQuestions acknowledges that this is "often used as an illustration of Jesus' offer of salvation to individuals," but corrects: "Jesus is not pleading with an individual to be saved; He's seeking admittance to a church" [^6]. Combined with Holman Hunt's famous painting (no handle on the outside), this verse functions as the paradigmatic image of Jesus as a gentleman who will not force entry. R.C. Sproul frequently identified this as one of the most misused verses in evangelicalism, ripped from its ecclesiastical context and applied to individual soteriology.

**2 Peter 3:9 ("not willing that any should perish")** is a primary Arminian pillar text. R.C. Sproul delivers the decisive rebuttal: "If we take the blanket statement, 'God is not willing that any should perish,' and apply the sovereign efficacious will to it, the conclusion is obvious. **No one will perish.** If God sovereignly decrees that no one should perish, and God is God, then certainly no one will ever perish. This would be a proof text not for Arminianism but for universalism. The text would then prove too much for Arminians." Sproul notes the pronouns: the "us" in 2 Peter 3:9 ("the Lord is longsuffering toward _us_") refers to Peter's audience, namely the elect, the "beloved" [^7]. James White concurs: "2 Peter 3:9 notes that God is not willing that _his people_ perish" [^8].

**1 Timothy 2:4 ("who desires all people to be saved")** receives two main treatments within the historical Protestant tradition. A longstanding Protestant exegetical tradition, shared by Calvin, Owen, Sproul, White, and others, reads "all" as "all sorts of men," noting the context of 1 Timothy 2:1-2 instructs prayer "for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions," so the "all" in verse 4 means all _kinds_ of people, including rulers, not every individual head for head. Piper takes a different route, affirming God genuinely desires all to be saved in one sense but that "his supreme commitment to uphold and display the full range of his glory through the sovereign demonstration of his wrath and mercy" takes priority in what is known as the "two wills" framework [^9].

**Ezekiel 18:23 ("Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked?"), John 7:17, Romans 10:9-10, and Acts 2:21** all follow similar patterns. The popular reading treats each as proof of human autonomous agency. Reading each verse in its covenantal and grammatical context, however, grounds them in prior divine initiative. Acts 2:21 is particularly instructive because it quotes Joel 2:32, whose full text reads: "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved… and **among the survivors shall be those whom the LORD calls**." The verse itself teaches dual calling: humans call on God, grounded in God's first calling of them. Peter confirms this pattern at Acts 2:39: "the promise is for… **everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself**."

## 2. Charles Finney systematically rewired American hermeneutics

No single figure did more to embed free-will presuppositions into the bloodstream of American evangelicalism than **Charles Grandison Finney (1792-1875)**. Before examining his theological departures, though, honesty requires acknowledging what his movement genuinely produced.

### What Finney's movement got right

Finney was a committed abolitionist at a time when much of American Christianity was not. When he moved to New York City in 1832, he took "the breathtaking step of barring all slave owners and traders from Communion" [^56]. His _Lectures on Revivals of Religion_ (1835) called slavery "a great national sin" and placed blame squarely on the church: "It is the very fact that ministers and professors of religion of different denominations hold slaves, which sanctifies the whole abomination, in the eyes of ungodly men" [^57]. He linked revival directly to abolition: "I believe that the revival in the United States will continue and prevail, no farther and faster than the church take right ground upon this subject" [^57]. A study published through Project MUSE concludes that Finney held "a firm commitment to abolitionism" and "a conviction that Christian indifference to slavery impeded the great work of spreading the gospel" [^58].

**Oberlin College** stands as one of the most remarkable institutional achievements of American Christianity. Founded in 1833 and coeducational from its opening day, it became in 1835 the first institution in the United States to admit students of any race as a matter of official policy [^59]. By 1900 it had produced one-third of all African American college graduates in the nation. Finney served there as professor of theology and then president.

The tradition that Finney's revivalism helped shape has also produced serious scholars. **Thomas C. Oden** (1931-2016), a Methodist theologian, spent his early career in Bultmann, Tillich, and Marxism before being challenged by a Jewish colleague at Drew University to read Athanasius, Augustine, and Aquinas. That encounter transformed him. He coined the term "paleo-orthodoxy," produced a three-volume systematic theology (_Classic Christianity_), and served as general editor of the 29-volume _Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture_ [^67]. Other significant Wesleyan scholars include William J. Abraham (DPhil, Oxford, Albert Cook Outler Professor of Wesley Studies at SMU) and Ben Witherington III (PhD, Durham, whose New Testament commentaries cover every book of the canon). These scholars represent the best of a tradition that deserves fair acknowledgment.

**With this real legacy on the table**, the specific hermeneutical problem I want to examine is narrower: the axiom that human moral ability is the non-negotiable starting point for reading Scripture. Whatever goods the Second Great Awakening and its streams produced socially and institutionally, the hermeneutical assumption embedded in Finney's system is what this blog is tracking. Michael Horton's assessment stands: "No single man is more responsible for the distortion of Christian truth in our age than Charles Grandison Finney" [^10].

### Finney's core doctrinal departures

Finney's _Systematic Theology_ (1846/1878) rejected virtually every doctrine the Reformation recovered. On **original sin**, he was explicit: "Original sin, physical regeneration, and all their kindred and resulting dogmas, are alike subversive of the gospel, and repulsive to the human intelligence" (_Systematic Theology_, p. 236; cited in Horton [^10]). He called inherited depravity an "anti-scriptural and nonsensical dogma" (p. 179, Bethany 1976 edition). Jay E. Smith's analysis in _Trinity Journal_ 13NS (1992) confirms: "For Finney, moral depravity consists in voluntary sinning with absolutely no direct connection to Adam or his sin" [^11].

On **substitutionary atonement**, Finney rejected imputation entirely: "The doctrine of imputed righteousness, or that Christ's obedience to the law was accounted as our obedience, is founded on a most false and nonsensical assumption." Christ's righteousness "could do no more than justify himself. It can never be imputed to us" (_Systematic Theology_, pp. 320-322). On **justification by faith alone**, Finney taught that "the Christian is justified no longer than he obeys, and must be condemned when he disobeys" (p. 46), and that "perseverance in obedience to the end of life is also a condition of justification" (pp. 326-327). He declared the Reformation doctrine of _simul justus et peccator_ (simultaneously justified and sinner) to be an error that "has slain more souls, I fear, than all the Universalism that ever cursed the world" (p. 60).

### The hermeneutical method behind the departures

Finney's own preface to his _Systematic Theology_ reveals his fundamental hermeneutical move. He wrote: "I could not but perceive that the true idea of moral government had no place in the theology of the church… The doctrines of a nature, sinful per se, of a necessitated will, of inability, and of physical regeneration… embarrassed and even confounded me at every step. I often said to myself, **'If these things are really taught in the Bible, I must be an infidel.'** But the more I read my Bible, the more clearly I saw that these things were not found there upon any fair principles of interpretation, such as would be admitted in a court of justice" [^12].

This passage is hermeneutically revealing. Finney applied legal/courtroom standards of interpretation to Scripture and treated human moral ability as axiomatic. If a doctrine (like original sin or inability) seemed unreasonable by those standards, it could not be what Scripture teaches. As the _Master's Seminary Journal_ notes: "Finney's emphasis upon 'the philosophy or the workings of my own mind as they were revealed in consciousness' in his hermeneutic allowed him to modify Old School positions in order to maximize his evangelistic appeal" [^13].

### The confessional Protestant tradition's verdict

The critique of Finney is not the exclusive property of Reformed theology. It runs through the entire Protestant confessional tradition, drawing on distinct theological grammars that arrive at the same conclusion.

**B.B. Warfield** devoted an extensive chapter to Finney in _Studies in Perfectionism_ (1931-32), concluding: "It is quite clear that what Finney gives us is less a theology than a system of morals. **God might be eliminated from it entirely without essentially changing its character**" [^14]. Warfield described Finney's system as one where "the initiative belongs to man; everywhere and always God's action is suspended upon man's will."

**R.C. Sproul** was direct: "He rejected not only Augustinianism, but he also rejected semi-Pelagianism and stood clearly on the subject of unvarnished Pelagianism, saying in no uncertain terms, without any ambiguity, that there was no Fall and that there is no such thing as original sin." He added: **"He is the patron saint of twentieth-century Evangelicalism. And he is not semi-Pelagian; he is unvarnished in his Pelagianism."** [^15]

**From the Lutheran tradition**, **Gerhard Forde** (1927-2005), Professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary, identified the hermeneutical stakes with precision: "If you begin with the assumption of freedom, the preoccupation is always how to keep freedom in check, how to bind; but if you begin with the assumption of bondage, the preoccupation is always how to set out the word that frees" [^49]. This is exactly the presupposition argument in Lutheran dress: your starting anthropology determines your entire interpretive framework. **Rod Rosenbladt**, Lutheran theologian and long-time co-host of the _White Horse Inn_, diagnosed the pastoral fallout: "We incline to moralism by nature. The theologies which draw us, as iron filings to a magnet, are the ones that have to do with self-improvement, with the righteousness of the Law" [^47]. **Steven Paulson**, Professor of Systematic Theology at Luther House of Study, states the Lutheran position without hedging: "There is no free will, no choice, no decision, no acknowledgement, acceptance or any other verb you could try to give the human in relation to the Creator" [^50]. **Bryan Wolfmueller** (LCMS pastor) captures the pastoral alternative with memorable brevity: "We Lutherans ask a different question: not, Have you made a decision for Jesus? But rather, Has Jesus made a decision for you?" [^51]

Tom Baker's "Walther and Finney" (_Issues, Etc. Journal_, Summer 1997) sets C.F.W. Walther (founder of the LCMS) directly against Finney. Walther taught: "The Word of God is not properly divided when one makes an appeal to believe in a manner as if a person could make himself believe or at least help towards that end, instead of preaching faith into a person's heart by laying the Gospel promises before him." Against this, Finney declared: "The moral government of God everywhere assumes and implies the liberty of the human will, and the natural ability of man to obey God." Baker concluded that Finney's gatherings "had to be 'seeker-sensitive' since he was attempting to change the will of his hearers who were, in his mind, capable of making a decision to be saved" [^48].

**From the Anglican tradition**, J.I. Packer (1926-2020), the most influential Anglican evangelical theologian of the twentieth century, co-translated Luther's _Bondage of the Will_ into English and argued in its introduction: "The man who has not yet practically and experimentally learned the bondage of his will in sin has not yet comprehended any part of the Gospel." He warned that "much modern Protestantism would be neither owned nor even recognised by the pioneer Reformers. Has not Protestantism today become more Erasmian than Lutheran?" [^52]

### The trickle-down effect from Finney to the modern pew

Finney's most consequential innovation was methodological. His _Lectures on Revivals of Religion_ (1835) contains the foundational claim: "A revival is not a miracle, nor dependent on a miracle, in any sense. It is a purely philosophical result of the right use of the constituted means, as much so as any other effect produced by the application of means" (pp. 4-5). He declared it "dangerous" to believe revival depends on divine activity.

This produced the **"anxious bench"** (precursor to the modern altar call), which Finney explicitly compared to baptism's role in the apostolic church [^17]. The methodology evolved through a direct lineage: **Finney to D.L. Moody** (adapted into the "Inquiry Room") to **Billy Sunday** (the "sawdust trail") to **Billy Graham** (refined with trained counselors and music) to **Bill Bright's "Four Spiritual Laws"** (late 1950s).

A crucial caveat is needed here. This lineage is **methodological, not strictly doctrinal**, and the theological range across these figures is wide. Moody organized his theology around the "Three R's": Ruined by the Fall, Redeemed by the Blood, and Regenerated by the Spirit, an explicit affirmation of human depravity that Finney called "anti-scriptural and nonsensical" [^65]. Billy Sunday was an ordained Presbyterian who affirmed the virgin birth, bodily resurrection, and substitutionary atonement. Billy Graham grew up Presbyterian, memorized the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and Carl F.H. Henry located him theologically in "a moderate Calvinistic framework": Graham "takes no cheap fickle view of sin" and preached substitutionary atonement "in its Reformation dimensions as propitiating the wrath of the holy Lord" [^63]. Tom Nettles, assessing Graham from a Reformed Baptist perspective, concluded he was "more confessionally evangelical than Finney, though he might not have discerned the importance of that distinct difference" [^64]. Graham himself praised Finney: "Few men have had such a profound impact on their generation" (Foreword to Lewis Drummond's _The Life and Ministry of Charles G. Finney_, 1983), but that admiration was for Finney's evangelistic reach, not his theology.

What unites this lineage is not doctrine but method. The anxious bench, the inquiry room, the sawdust trail, the altar call, and the sinner's prayer all **functionally presuppose** libertarian free will even when the practitioner would not confess it at the theological level. The method embodies an anthropology, and in American evangelicalism, the method won [^66]. Graham could confess sovereign grace on Sunday and perfect Finney's decisional machinery on Monday. The presupposition lives in the practice, not only in the creed. Cameron Buettel of Grace to You traces the seeker-sensitive movement directly to this dynamic: "Finney's fingerprints are all over modern seeker-sensitive strategies… those who pioneered the seeker-sensitive megachurch juggernaut in America were practical Pelagians" [^18]. The net result is that Finney's hermeneutical assumption -- human moral ability as the interpretive starting point -- became the invisible default of American evangelical Bible reading, even among churches that would never consciously endorse Pelagianism.

## 3. "Love requires freedom": a philosophical axiom masquerading as biblical truth

This is one I hear a lot. The claim that love requires libertarian free will, meaning genuine love is impossible unless the lover has the metaphysical ability to do otherwise, has become perhaps the most widespread theological assumption in American popular Christianity. **This slogan does not appear anywhere in Scripture.** As GotQuestions.org itself acknowledges in one notable article: "The 'standard' answer seems to be that, for love to be real, it must not be coerced… **The problem with this line of thinking is that, although it may be somewhat satisfying intellectually, it is never articulated in Scripture**" [^19]. This is a striking admission from the very site that elsewhere functionally assumes the principle.

### C.S. Lewis provided the popular formulation

The claim's dominance in popular Christianity traces primarily to **C.S. Lewis**. In _Mere Christianity_ (1952), Lewis wrote: "Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata, which consists of creatures that worked like machines, would hardly be worth creating." In _The Problem of Pain_ (1940), he argued that God _cannot_ create free creatures and simultaneously withhold free will from them, treating this as a logical impossibility. His concept in _The Great Divorce_ (1945) that "the doors of hell are locked from the inside," emphasizing humans freely choosing separation from God, became the default evangelical explanation for hell. As much as I appreciate Lewis, he was not a systematic theologian. As one reviewer noted, "In the times when he talks about 'free will,' it isn't necessary. All that is necessary is moral responsibility, not this idea of free will" [^20].

### Philosophical systematization through Plantinga and Craig

**Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense** (finalized in _God, Freedom, and Evil_, 1977) gave the claim rigorous philosophical form: "To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, he must create creatures capable of moral evil; and he cannot leave these creatures free to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so" (pp. 166-167) [^21]. Plantinga explicitly defines freedom in libertarian terms: "no antecedent conditions and/or causal laws determine that he will perform the action." Critics note this presupposes libertarian incompatibilist free will, and the careful philosophical distinction that Plantinga's defense (he's a Calvinist, for the record) shows mere logical _possibility_, not God's actual reasons, has been **widely lost** in popular theology, where the defense is treated as revealing God's actual motivation.

**William Lane Craig** systematized the claim within Molinism: "Once you are causally determined by factors outside yourself to do what you do, then it seems to me that in no significant sense are these actions up to you. And therefore moral praise and blame, for example, would become impossible" [^22]. Craig explicitly connects libertarian freedom to the possibility of genuine love and moral responsibility.

### My Rebuttal

**First, the Trinitarian argument.** The love within the Trinity, between Father, Son, and Spirit, is the highest, most perfect form of love in existence. Yet this love is **necessary**, not contingent. The Father _necessarily_ loves the Son; neither has the "ability to do otherwise." If "love requires libertarian freedom" were true, then God's own intra-Trinitarian love would not be genuine love, an absurd conclusion. Greg Koukl (Stand to Reason) makes this point directly: "It doesn't seem that God has the freedom NOT to love, because goodness, and therefore love, is essential to His nature. And if love requires freedom, then God doesn't truly love" [^23].

**Second, the Christological argument.** Jonathan Edwards, working within a tradition Luther had established in _De Servo Arbitrio_ and Calvin and Turretin had developed, argued that **Jesus could not have sinned** (the impeccability of Christ), yet His perfect obedience and love were genuinely virtuous and praiseworthy. As documented in The Gospel Coalition's _Themelios_: "In order to show that liberty of indifference was not necessary for moral responsibility, Jonathan Edwards argued that Jesus's actions were necessary, and yet, they were morally praiseworthy" [^24]. If the most virtuous being who ever lived could not have done otherwise, libertarian freedom is demonstrably unnecessary for genuine love.

**Third, Luther's argument from the nature of the will.** Luther argued in _De Servo Arbitrio_ (1525) that genuine freedom means acting according to one's nature without external coercion, not possessing the metaphysical ability to do otherwise. Fallen humans freely choose sin because their nature is enslaved; regenerated humans freely love God because God has changed their nature [^44]. Edwards's _Freedom of the Will_ (1754), which Sproul called "the most important theological work ever published in America," refined the same compatibilist argument across the following centuries: the will always acts according to its strongest inclination, which is compatible with genuine love because the person does what they most want to do. J.I. Packer reinforced this from the Anglican tradition when he deliberately reframed the pastoral question in _Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God_ (1961) as a tension between sovereignty and _responsibility_, not sovereignty and _free will_, deliberately avoiding the libertarian framing [^52]. Thaddeus Williams's academic monograph _Love, Freedom, and Evil: Does Authentic Love Require Free Will?_ (Rodopi, 2011) provides the fullest treatment, "masterfully dismantling this argument with biblical compatibilism" [^25].

## 4. The cultural ecosystem that made free will feel "obvious"

The free-will hermeneutic did not emerge from careful exegesis. It was cultivated by a constellation of cultural forces that made libertarian autonomy feel self-evidently true to American Christians, so obvious it did not need to be argued for, only assumed.

### Jacksonian democracy made election feel un-American

Nathan Hatch's landmark _The Democratization of American Christianity_ (Yale, 1989) demonstrates that the populist movements of the early republic (1790s-1840s) fundamentally reshaped theology. Hatch documents how five mass movements (the Christian movement, Methodists, Baptists, Black churches, and Mormons) "offered compelling visions of individual potential and collective aspiration to the unschooled and unsophisticated." These movements were "opposed to 'priestcraft' and to the passivity they believed was instilled by Calvinist theology" and "believed that they could make salvation available directly to the ordinary individual in the marketplace of ideas." Hatch's book includes an appendix titled "A sampling of anticlerical and anti-Calvinist Christian verse," illustrating how populist movements specifically targeted doctrines of election as **spiritual aristocracy** incompatible with democratic principles [^26]. The label "Calvinist" in this context was popular shorthand for the confessional Protestant inheritance broadly: the doctrines of divine sovereignty and human inability that these movements rejected were equally embedded in Lutheran and Anglican confessions, not unique to the Reformed tradition.

The Jacksonian era's egalitarianism made the confessional Protestant doctrine of divine election seem politically repugnant. As Scott Aniol observes: "Americans became known for a kind of 'rugged individualism' and distrust of systems of authority or anything that resembled class distinctions. Individuals expected to have a say in how they lived and what they believed" [^27].

### The Second Great Awakening completed the theological revolution

The contrast between the two Great Awakenings crystallizes the transformation as sharply as anything in American religious history. As _Desiring God_ summarizes: "The evangelical faith of the First Great Awakening in America was almost uniformly Calvinist. That of the Second Great Awakening was a mix of Calvinist and Arminian convictions. If Jonathan Edwards's theology was representative of the First Great Awakening, John Wesley's was more typical of the Second" [^30]. The _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ confirms: "During the Second Great Awakening revivalistic theology in many denominations shifted from Calvinism to a practical Arminianism as preachers emphasized the ability of sinners to make an immediate decision for their salvation" [^31].

The EBSCO Research overview captures the synthesis: "Methodist acceptance of the doctrine that individuals have free will to attain salvation was in accord with a general shift of theological emphasis within American Protestantism in the early nineteenth century… **by the Jacksonian period the message of free will seemed to many the spiritual counterpart of suffrage and laissez-faire**" [^32]. Camp meetings reinforced the shift. Britannica notes that "the emphasis on a sudden conversion experience tended to reduce doctrinal preaching to a minimum, break down the old creedal standards, and undermine the concept of a learned pastoral ministry" [^33].

What made the Second Great Awakening decisive, however, was not merely a change in theological opinion but the creation of entirely new **institutional structures that embedded free-will assumptions into the operating system of American Protestantism**. Take the camp meeting, pioneered on the Kentucky frontier at Cane Ridge in 1801 under Barton W. Stone (drawing an estimated ten to twenty thousand participants over several days). That was no simple gathering for worship; it was a technology for producing mass conversion events understood as individual decisions. The emotional intensity of the camp meeting was designed to bring people to a moment of conscious choice, and "success" was measured by the number of visible responses. The theology had to match the method: if the method assumed people could and must decide, the theology had to insist they possessed the ability to do so.

The denominational consequences were rapid and lasting. **Baptist churches**, which in the New England and mid-Atlantic colonies had been dominated by Particular (Calvinist) theology since the Philadelphia Baptist Association (1707) and the Second London Confession (1689), saw a decisive demographic shift on the frontier toward General Baptist and Arminian convictions. Methodism, already Arminian in its Wesleyan origins, surged to become the largest Protestant denomination in America by 1850, spreading its conviction of free will and resistible grace through an unmatched circuit rider network. **Presbyterians experienced a major schism in 1837**, with the "Old School" (emphasizing strict subscription to the Westminster Confession and opposing the Plan of Union with Congregationalists) and the "New School" (more open to revivalist methodology and less rigid on confessional subscription) dividing over a tangle of theological, organizational, and regional concerns. This split deserves careful framing: the New School was not simply Arminian. Most remained within the Edwardsian Calvinist tradition, and there was considerable theological diversity among them. Finney himself was a Presbyterian minister and his "New Measures" became a flashpoint, but he represented an extreme end of a wide spectrum, and many New School Presbyterians would have rejected his more radical theological conclusions.

The deeper hermeneutical consequence was a fundamental **redefinition of what conversion is**. Prior to the Second Great Awakening, the dominant model of conversion in confessional Protestant communities was not an instantaneous decision but an extended process of examination: testing one's heart, waiting on the Spirit, discerning the marks of grace. Jonathan Edwards's _Religious Affections_ (1746) was precisely this kind of careful, cautious engagement with the question of authentic conversion. The Second Great Awakening replaced this model with what historians call **"decisionism"**: conversion as a datable, volitional event where the individual exercises the ability to choose Christ. This restructuring meant that the entire theological apparatus supporting sovereign grace (inability, effectual calling, irresistible grace) became not merely theologically disputed but increasingly sidelined in practice. If conversion is a decision, the preacher's job is to maximize the conditions for that decision, not to proclaim a gospel that waits on the Holy Spirit's sovereign work. Detailed doctrinal instruction increasingly gave way to immediate appeals for response.

The institutional legacy cemented these assumptions across generations. Sunday school curricula, tract societies, and the great voluntary associations of the antebellum period (the American Bible Society, the American Tract Society, the American Home Missionary Society) were all built on a free-will evangelistic model. They produced millions of pamphlets, tracts, and catechisms framing salvation as a choice available to all who would exercise it. By the time Finney systematized this theology in his _Systematic Theology_ (1846), he was not innovating so much as codifying what the Second Great Awakening had already established as the default American Protestant approach. **The Awakening created the market; Finney gave it its most rigorous and theologically consequential rationale.** This is why Finney cannot be understood in isolation: he was the culmination and theologian of a movement that had already reshaped American Christianity from the ground up.

### Consumer culture made salvation a product to choose

David Wells's _No Place for Truth_ (Eerdmans, 1993) documents how consumer capitalism colonized the church: "The churches, in larger and larger numbers, are adapting themselves to felt needs in the congregations much as a business might adapt its product to a market. In other words, the Church is sanctioning the idea that when someone comes in its doors it's okay to view that person as a consumer." James K.A. Smith's _Desiring the Kingdom_ (Baker Academic, 2009) argues that "secular liturgies" like the mall, the stadium, and the market form desires that compete with Christian formation. He warns that evangelical worship often trains "people to be more like individual consumers or spectators than like a community of Christ followers" [^34]. Roger Finke and Rodney Stark's _The Churching of America_ (Rutgers, 1992) explicitly models American religion as a "free market economy where churches compete for souls," a framework that itself presupposes and reinforces free-will theological assumptions.

The ubiquitous evangelical language of "accepting Jesus," "making a decision for Christ," and "inviting Jesus into your heart" reflects both Finney's decision theology and consumer-choice culture. Salvation is framed as a transaction where the individual is the sovereign agent selecting a product.

## 5. GotQuestions.org as the default American hermeneutic

GotQuestions.org receives approximately **17.79 million visits per month** (Semrush, March 2025), with over **2.5 billion cumulative pageviews** and content in **185 languages**. It reaches roughly **three to four times** more people than DesiringGod.org (~4.6 million monthly visits). With 52.69% of traffic from organic Google search, its articles appear at or near the top of search results for virtually any Bible question. This makes GotQuestions the single most influential theological resource for average English-speaking Christians, and its hermeneutical framing shapes how millions read the Bible.

### Five recurring hermeneutical patterns

**Pattern 1: The "mystery" framework.** Nearly every sovereignty-related article opens with a variation of "it is impossible for us to fully understand the dynamics of a holy God molding and shaping the will of man" [^35]. The Calvinism-vs.-Arminianism article concludes: "both systems fail in that they attempt to explain the unexplainable" [^36]. The founder, S. Michael Houdmann, self-identifies as a "Calminian" who "essentially gave up trying to fully understand" [^37]. This "mystery" framing effectively neutralizes the question rather than resolving it exegetically.

**Pattern 2: "Both extremes are wrong."** GotQuestions consistently frames sovereignty and free will as two poles: "Some emphasize the sovereignty of God to the point that human beings are little more than robots… Others emphasize free will to the point of God not having complete control… **Neither of these positions is biblical**" [^35]. This false equivalence treats divine sovereignty, an attribute of God's nature, as equivalent in theological weight to human free will, which is a debated anthropological claim.

**Pattern 3: "God will not force/coerce."** The phrase "He will not force anyone to come to Him" or its equivalent appears across multiple articles. BibleStudyTools is more explicit: "As much as he loves mankind, he will not override man's will" [^38]. Christianity.com states: "When God first created man, He established free will" [^39].

**Pattern 4: Universal texts read at face value.** 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9 are consistently cited as teaching God's desire to save every individual, with human free will as the sole limiting factor. GotQuestions writes: "He desires that all would be saved and come to repentance (1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9). He offers salvation to everyone (Titus 2:11) yet He will not force anyone to come to Him" [^40].

**Pattern 5: Sovereignty redefined to include permission.** GotQuestions states: "The right of God to _allow_ mankind's free choices is just as necessary for true sovereignty as His ability to enact His will" [^41]. This subtly redefines sovereignty from God's active decree over all things to God's _permission_ of autonomous human choices, **a move that makes sovereignty derivative of and limited by free will.**

### The contrast with confessional Protestant sources is stark

The critique here is not uniquely Reformed. Ligonier Ministries (R.C. Sproul) explicitly rejects the false symmetry: "When we talk about God's sovereignty and human free agency, **we're not talking about apples and apples.** The sovereignty of an omnipotent God is different than a free agency choice that a human makes. It's not bringing together two equal things. He is sovereign. We are responsible. He is _ultimately_ sovereign over all things. We are _penultimately_ responsible" [^42]. Desiring God insists: "The new birth brings about faith. Faith is, therefore, not the result of human self-determination but of the new birth" [^43].

The confessional Lutheran tradition says the same from its own vocabulary. The Formula of Concord, Article II teaches that in spiritual matters the unregenerate will is "like a pillar of salt, like Lot's wife, yes, like a log and a stone, like a lifeless statue." Luther's Small Catechism states it with elementary plainness: "I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel" [^55]. The Anglican tradition is no different. Thomas Cranmer's official Homily of the Misery of All Mankind (1547), appointed to be read in all Church of England parishes, contains the line that is hard to misread: "Of ourselves we be crab trees, that can bring forth no apples" [^53].

Where popular sites treat sovereignty and free will as co-equal mysteries to be balanced, the confessional Protestant tradition, Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed alike, insists on asymmetry: God's sovereignty is primary and enabling; human responsibility is real, but derivative and subordinate.

## Conclusion: the corrective starts with recognizing the presupposition

The research reveals a consistent pattern: **the free-will hermeneutic begins with an anthropological assumption (humans possess libertarian free will) and reads Scripture to confirm it**, while the historical Protestant hermeneutic begins with theology proper (God's sovereignty, omniscience, aseity, immutability) and reads human agency in light of it. The free-will starting point was not discovered in Scripture. It was culturally constructed through Jacksonian democracy (making election seem elitist), the Second Great Awakening (transforming conversion into a decisionist event and structurally encoding free-will assumptions into American evangelical institutions), Finney's systematic theological rationale for that movement, and consumer capitalism (making salvation a personal choice in a spiritual marketplace).

This was the consensus position of the Reformation and its heirs long before "Calvinist" became a sectarian label. Luther articulated it against Erasmus in 1525. The Augsburg Confession encoded it for Lutherans in 1530. The Thirty-Nine Articles embedded it in Anglican worship in 1571. The Westminster divines and Puritans carried it into the English-speaking Reformed world. The confessional Baptist tradition enshrined it in the Second London Confession of 1689. The free-will hermeneutic is the newcomer in this story, not the historic default.

The corrective is not to swap one presupposition for another but to teach Bible readers to recognize what they are carrying to the text before they open it. The "ought implies can" assumption -- the conviction that a God who commands must be commanding something we can already do -- is so embedded in American Christian intuition that it does not feel like a presupposition. It feels like common sense. The Reformation's great insistence, shared across Lutheran, Anglican, and Reformed confessions, is that this common sense is precisely what Scripture overturns. Commands reveal duty. Grace delivers ability. That order is not a Reformed idiosyncrasy. It is the hinge, as Luther said, on which the whole Reformation turned.
