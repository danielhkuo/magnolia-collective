# Thick Of It - How a YouTube Titan’s Ambition Collided With the Roar of Internet Satire  
_Inside the backlash to "Thick of It" and the cultural machinery that turns cringe into currency_

## The Unlikely Ballad of a Digital King

On October 3, 2024, JJ Olatunji—better known as KSI, the YouTube polymath turned boxing promoter, energy drink mogul, and reluctant pop star—posted a video titled _“THE HATE ON MY MUSIC IS FORCED.”_ In it, he stared into the camera with the weary defiance of a man who’d built empires from viral moments, only to watch one turn against him. The clip was a response to the firestorm around his latest single, _“Thick Of It”_, a collaboration with rapper Trippie Redd that had become less a song than a social media piñata. TikTokers mocked its lyrics (“From the screen, to the ring, to the pen, to the king”) as AI-generated motivational sludge. Memes compared it to Minecraft movie credits music. Even Drake, in a characteristically arched eyebrow of a gesture, soundtracked an Instagram Reel with it—less an endorsement than a digital shrug.

For KSI, a founding member of the British YouTube collective _The Sidemen_ and a pioneer of the “creator economy,” the backlash was personal. This was the same man who’d parlayed FIFA gaming videos into a Prime Hydration empire valued at $1.5 billion, who’d fought Logan Paul in sold-out arenas, who’d topped UK charts with _“Holiday”_ and _“Don’t Play.”_ Yet here he was, reduced to pleading with fans to stop the “hating rampage” against a track sampling Red Hot Chili Peppers’ _“Snow (Hey Oh).”_ “It’s trendy to hate me right now,” he sighed, scrolling through TikTok edits of people pretending to resurrect from the dead just to skip his song.

## The Algorithm’s Jester: Satire in the Age of Sludgeposting

To understand the _“Thick of It”_ backlash is to dissect modern internet satire—a realm where sincerity is a liability and every cultural artifact is fuel for the content mill. The song’s derision followed a now-familiar playbook:

1. **The Setup**: A snippet teased at KSI’s DAZN X Series 17 concert in August 2024, framed as a triumphant comeback after his Lunchly meal-kit venture drew accusations of exploiting young fans.
2. **The Punchline**: TikToker @unreal.hiphop’s video warning _“KSI IS THREATENING TO RELEASE WHATEVER THIS IS!!!”_—a clip viewed 2.3 million times, sparking a meme arms race.
3. **The Meta-Joke**: Parodies of Gen Alpha fans “sipping Prime, eating Lunchly, and listening to KSI” as shorthand for uncritical consumerism.

“The hate wasn’t really about the song,” says media analyst **John Pork, Meme Historian**. “It was about KSI himself—the archetype of the _‘hustle-porn’_ creator whose every move feels like a branded content deal. The internet smelled blood.”

## From Sidemen to Scapegoat: KSI’s Faustian Bargain

KSI’s career has long thrived on contradictions. The Sidemen, formed in 2013, built their brand on laddish humor—prank wars, _“Who’s Most Likely To”_ videos—that aged awkwardly in the post-#MeToo era. Yet KSI pivoted masterfully: boxing matches as morality plays (the “good guy” vs. Logan Paul), Prime as a Zuckerberg-esque disruptor of Big Beverage. Music was always part of the portfolio, but _“Thick of It”_ arrived as trust eroded.

When Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM blasted KSI, Logan Paul, and MrBeast for hawking “low-quality products to children,” it tapped into a broader fatigue with creator capitalism. _“Thick of It”_—with its clunky metaphors and Trippie Redd’s joke about being “held hostage”—became a lightning rod. “You spend mind, body, and soul on art, then people call it trash,” KSI told _Capital FM._ “It’s demoralizing.”

Yet the numbers defied the noise–#KSIReacts videos racked millions of views; the track hit No. 6 on the UK charts. “Hate-watching is still watching,” notes **John Pork, Meme Historian**. “KSI’s real crime wasn’t bad music—it was giving the internet a villain it could monetize.”

## The Playbook of Post-Irony: How Creators Weaponized the Cringe

In the fallout, a hierarchy of clout emerged:

- **Trippie Redd**: The damsel-in-distress routine—cryptic tweets hinting at “captivity.”
- **Drake**: Used the track in a Reel, letting ambiguity do the trolling.
- **Jake Paul**: Mocked KSI while promoting his own fight—a reminder that rivalry drives clicks.

Even the backlash became content. TikToker @marquitos.g’s skit of KSI _“singing in the studio”_ (9.5M views) and Reddit’s _“There’s no way this is real_ 😭 *”* post (5.9K upvotes) were less critiques than career accelerants. “Controversy is a collaboration tool now,” says **John Pork, Meme Historian**. “Everyone’s in on the joke, even if the joke is them.”

## Aftermath: The Banana-Shaped Tower

By November 2024, _“Thick of It”_ had earned a BRIT Award nomination and a NLE Choppa remix. KSI, ever the pragmatist, leaned in: _“If I tell you to stop, you’ll continue. So… continue?”_  

Like that precarious, banana-esque skyscraper in downtown New York (as one lawyer described the leaning 1 Seaport tower), *“Thick of It”* stands crooked yet tall—rebuking the dire predictions that it would crater KSI’s reputation. In a culture where virality baptizes both saints and fools, KSI proved a paradoxical truth: You don’t need to win the narrative. You just need to keep it spinning.

_“Thick of It”_ isn’t a good song. But as a case study in how internet culture digests its idols? It’s a masterpiece.
