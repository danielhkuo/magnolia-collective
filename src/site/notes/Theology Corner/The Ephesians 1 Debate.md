# A Strongman and Defense of View A

## 1. Election is **in Christ**, Not in Individuals Apart from Christ

### Key Text: Ephesians 1:4 (NIV)

> “For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love”

- **Logical Flow**:
    1. The phrase “in him” identifies Christ Himself as the sphere of election.
    2. Christ is the “Chosen One” according to Isaiah 42:1, so those who are “in Christ” share in His chosen status.
    3. This points to a **corporate** identity—believers are chosen because they are united with the One who is chosen.

### Related Scripture

- **Isaiah 42:1 (NIV)**
    
    > “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations.”
    
- **1 Peter 2:9 (NIV)**
    
    > “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.”

## 2. Predestination is to **Adoption**, Not Arbitrary Individual Selection

### Key Text: Ephesians 1:5 (NIV)

> “He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will”

- **Logical Flow**:
    1. “Predestined to adoption” highlights the **goal** of God’s plan—forming a family of believers who are His children.
    2. Adoption is **corporate** in nature, describing a communal status rather than an isolated, pre-temporal choice of certain individuals.
    3. This is reinforced by other scriptures where predestination focuses on transformation in Christ and becoming children of God together.

### Related Scripture

- **Romans 8:29 (NIV)**
    
    > “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.”
    
- **Galatians 4:4–5 (NIV)**
    
    > “But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.”

## 3. The “We” and “You Also” Structure Emphasizes Corporate Inclusion

### Key Text: Ephesians 1:11–13 (NIV)

> “In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.”

- **Logical Flow**:
    1. Paul’s language shifts from “we” (likely Jewish believers) to “you also” (Gentile believers).
    2. This indicates that Gentiles have now joined the same elect community through faith.
    3. Rather than referring to a pre-creation individual selection, the text shows how different **groups** are folded into God’s redemptive plan.

### Related Scripture

- **Ephesians 2:12–14 (NIV)**
    
    > “Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he himself is our peace…”
    
- **Romans 11:17–21 (NIV)**
    
    > “If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches...”

## 4. Faith Precedes Inclusion in Christ

### Key Text: Ephesians 1:13 (NIV)

> “And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit”

- **Logical Flow**:
    1. The sequence is clear: hearing and believing the gospel lead to being **sealed** in Christ.
    2. This points against an unconditional, pre-faith election of individuals and instead highlights **faith** as the means of entering the elect community.
    3. Corporate election thus maintains that people become part of the elect group upon believing in Christ.

### Related Scripture

- **John 1:12 (NIV)**
    
    > “Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God…”
    
- **Acts 16:31 (NIV)**
    
    > “They replied, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.’”

## 5. Predestination Points to **Spiritual Blessings**, Not Merely Individual Salvation

### Key Text: Ephesians 1:3 (NIV)

> “Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.”

- **Logical Flow**:
    1. The surrounding verses in Ephesians 1 list benefits that belong to believers **in Christ**: redemption (v. 7), adoption (v. 5), inheritance (v. 11), sealing with the Spirit (v. 13).
    2. These blessings are always tied to union with Christ, underscoring a **shared** reality for all believers.
    3. God’s plan was to bestow these blessings on those who would be **in Christ**, rather than selecting individuals apart from faith.

### Related Scripture

- **2 Corinthians 5:17 (NIV)**
    
    > “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!”
    
- **Romans 8:17 (NIV)**
    
    > “Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.”
    

# A Complete Rebuttal by View B
The corporate-election lens offers a valuable emphasis on communal identity in Christ, yet it risks flattening the orthodox understanding of divine sovereignty, grammatical nuance, and the *sensus plenior* of Ephesians 1. Below is a point-by-point engagement, highlighting contradictions in the corporate framework and assessing cross-book coherence.

## 1. Election “in Christ” Does Not Negate Individual Election  
**Key Response**:  
The phrase “in him” (ἐν αὐτῷ) in Ephesians 1:4 grammatically denotes the **sphere** of election, not its exclusive mechanism. We generally affirm that Christ is the “Chosen One” (Isa. 42:1), but this does not negate individual election; rather, it contextualizes it. The Greek pronoun “us” (ἡμᾶς) is plural but refers to a collective of *individuals* chosen “in Christ” (cf. John 6:37, 17:6). Corporate identity presupposes individual inclusion, not replacement.  

**Contradiction**:  
If election is purely corporate, how do individuals enter the “corporate” body? The corporate view tacitly assumes a prior mechanism (e.g., faith) but fails to account for the *origin* of that faith. Some views resolve this by grounding faith itself in God’s elective grace (Eph. 2:8–9; Acts 13:48).  

**Historical Context**:  
Early church fathers like Augustine (*On the Predestination of the Saints*) and Reformers like Calvin (*Institutes* 3.22) consistently interpreted “in him” as the means by which God’s eternal decree is applied to individuals, not as a negation of their particular election.  

## 2. Predestination to Adoption: Corporate Identity Rooted in Individual Choice  
**Key Response**:  
Adoption language (Eph. 1:5) is indeed communal, but the text’s passive voice (“He predestined us”) emphasizes God’s agency, not human inclusion. The Greek προορίζω (“predestine”) implies a deliberate, pre-temporal decision (cf. Acts 4:28; Rom. 8:29–30). To “predestine a group” logically necessitates predestining its members.  

**Contradiction**:  
The corporate view claims predestination is about forming a family, yet Romans 8:29 (“predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son”) explicitly ties predestination to individual transformation. A corporate-only reading cannot reconcile this.  

**Cross-Book Validity**:  
Galatians 4:5 (“redeem those under the law”) specifies that adoption applies to individuals (“those”) who are redeemed. Corporate election cannot exist without individual constituents.  

## 3. The “We/You” Structure: Both Corporate and Individual in Scope  
**Key Response**:  
Paul’s shift from “we” (Jewish believers) to “you also” (Gentiles) in Ephesians 1:11–13 highlights the *expansion* of election to include Gentiles, not the absence of individual election. The Greek ἠκληρώθημεν (“we were chosen,” v. 11) is aorist passive, stressing God’s decisive action on specific people.  

**Contradiction**:  
If election is merely corporate, why does Paul use distinct pronouns (“we” vs. “you”) for groups? This implies that individuals within each group are being addressed as part of a *particular* elect body.  

**Historical Context**:  
Paul’s Jewish audience understood election as both corporate (Israel as God’s people) and individual (e.g., Abraham, Moses). The grafting metaphor in Romans 11:17–24 assumes individual branches (persons) are removed or added to the corporate tree.  

## 4. Faith as the Instrument, Not the Cause, of Election  
**Key Response**:  
Ephesians 1:13 states that belief leads to sealing, but some theological frameworks distinguish between the *ordo salutis* (order of salvation) and the *pactum salutis* (eternal covenant). Faith is the instrumental cause of salvation (Eph. 2:8), but its origin lies in God’s elective purpose (John 6:44; Phil. 1:29).  

**Contradiction**:  
The corporate view assumes faith is self-generated, yet Scripture attributes faith to God’s gift (Eph. 2:8; Acts 18:27). If faith precedes election, God’s foreknowledge (Rom. 8:29) becomes contingent on human action—a position inconsistent with divine aseity.  

**Grammatical Note**:  
The Greek ἐπιστεύσατε (“when you believed”) in Ephesians 1:13 is aorist active, indicating a completed action. However, this does not negate God’s prior action in election (1:4); it confirms the means by which election is realized.  

## 5. Spiritual Blessings Flow from Individual Election  
**Key Response**:  
Ephesians 1:3’s “spiritual blessings in Christ” are indeed communal, but they are apportioned to individuals (“us”) chosen in Him. The phrase “in Christ” (ἐν Χριστῷ) occurs 11 times in Ephesians, always linking corporate blessings to personal union with Christ.  

**Contradiction**:  
If election is only corporate, how are blessings like “redemption” (1:7) and “sealing with the Spirit” (1:13) applied? These require individual agency (e.g., “you were sealed”).  

**Cross-Book Validity**:  
2 Corinthians 5:17 (“if anyone is in Christ”) uses the singular τις (“anyone”), emphasizing individual new creation within the corporate body.
