The 2 major positions (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, though do require a logical ordering) are:

- **God creates vessels set aside for wrath for His glory so that the fullness of His love can be revealed through both wrath and mercy.**  
    This perspective holds that God, in His sovereign purpose, prepares some for judgment (wrath) and others for salvation (mercy), so that those who are saved can experience His love by being delivered from evil. For instance, **Isaiah 27:2–5** speaks of God’s appointed vessels and the ultimate fulfillment of His plan. In addition, **Romans 9:22–23** explains that God endures vessels of wrath in order to display the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy. Moreover, passages like **2 Thessalonians 1:8–9** and **Revelation 20:12–15** further underline the certainty of God’s righteous judgment alongside His saving grace.
    
- **God, being a God of will, made humans in His image with agency and responsibility for their actions.**  
    This view asserts that humans were created with free will—the genuine ability to choose, which includes the possibility of rejecting God and thus rejecting eternal life and goodness. **Romans 1:21–25** highlights how humanity, though created in God’s image, can fall into error and idolatry. This idea is also supported by **Genesis 1:26–27**, which affirms that humans were made in the image of God, implying inherent capacity for moral decision-making. **Genesis 2:16–17** presents the clear command in the Garden of Eden that introduces the possibility of disobedience. Further, **Deuteronomy 30:19** and **Joshua 24:15** remind us of the importance of choice—choosing life and obedience versus the path of sin. **John 7:17** reinforces that the act of choosing to follow God confirms the truth of His teachings.

The **Calvinist Reformed position** (which I ascribe to) argues that the second point (free will and human responsibility) flows out of the first (God’s sovereign election of vessels for wrath and mercy)[^1]. Conversely, the **Arminian position** generally contends that the first point flows out of the second.

Lutherans and Anglicans may lean toward one side or the other, or simply embrace the mystery of this logical ordering.

While I believe the Calvinist position is most Biblical, the important thing is that both points are upheld and held in tension, regardless of their logical sequence. Some Calvinists reject the second point and fall into fatalism, inadvertently making God the author of evil; some Arminians reject the first point altogether and fall into Pelagianism or open theism.

All orthodox Christians should agree: God is totally sovereign and perfectly good, and every individual bears the responsibility for his sin and is wholly dependent on God's grace and the work of Jesus for salvation. The different theological camps are, at their best, honest and faithful attempts to work out the tension of this paradox while remaining true to the gospel.

Responses inspired from Tobias Lanberry and Joshua Pearsall on Discord

[^1]: This might confuse some people on first glance. Free will isn’t just an add-on; **it’s the means by which God’s plan is actualized**. He doesn’t force salvation on anyone; instead, He grants genuine freedom so that His saving grace can be a true response to human choice, while those not chosen naturally fall into the path of sin and judgment.
