# On Humility  

I used to think submission was a frayed rope—something others tugged to drag me where I didn’t want to go. During house church, someone would make a theological comment, and I’d critique it in my head. When my mom gave advice about my career in computer science, especially about getting internships, I’d dismiss it outright, convinced she didn’t know better. Even in friendships, I’d bristle at unsolicited advice, my inner monologue chanting, *I know better.* Humility felt like a costume I could slip off when no one was looking.  

Then, one evening, I was reading 1 Peter 3: *“Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.”* The verse needled me. *What does it mean to show honor? To yield quietly? To surrender agency?* That night, I reread the passage, then stumbled on a sermon dissecting it—John Piper’s words on submission as strategy, not surrender. *“It doesn’t mean leaving your brain at the altar,”* he insisted. My confusion sharpened into curiosity.  

I usually talk to Pastor Sang (“PSang”) during his Office Hours, where he fields questions from college students in the New Life ministry. But on a different day, in a separate conversation, he made an argument that _Exodus Old and New: A Biblical Theology of Redemption_ by L. Michael Morales disproved the reliability of both Calvinism and Arminianism. That conclusion felt wrong—almost absurd. I had never read the book, but a quick Google search showed that Morales was a professor at a Reformed seminary. That didn’t disprove his argument outright, but it did seem to suggest that whatever he was saying wasn’t meant as a dismantling of Reformed theology.

So I pointed it out.

I wasn’t trying to start an argument, but I felt an immediate shift in the atmosphere. He responded briefly—saying it was an interesting point and that it would be great to have a conversation with the author at some point—but the conversation died right there. It was as if my comment had drained the energy from the discussion rather than adding to it. I sat with the discomfort. _Had I been too bold? Had I stepped out of place?_ I hadn’t meant to challenge his authority, but I still walked away with an unshakable tension. _Maybe submission means knowing when to speak and when to let something go._ But then the thought creeps in: _Am I actually searching for truth, or am I just trying to prove that I know enough to challenge him?_

Then there’s Pastor Eric, the head pastor at New Life. Sometimes I disagree with his theology, but my struggle isn’t just about the disagreement—it’s about how little engagement I feel when I ask him questions. I want deeper discussion, but I feel like I get half-answers. I’m left wondering, *Is this reluctance to explain a limitation of time, or is it something else?* It’s hard to submit to someone’s authority when it feels like they aren’t fully meeting me in my questions. But again, I have to ask: *Is my frustration about the answers I’m getting, or about the fact that I want to be seen as someone worth answering?*  

Submission, I began to see, is a thread woven through all relationships, not just church leadership. But that realization didn’t make it easier. *What do I do with authority I didn’t ask for—authority I don’t even respect?* I imagine scenarios where submission feels especially grating. A teaching assistant critiquing my essay with vague, surface-level feedback when I’ve studied the topic in depth. A church leader offering me spiritual guidance that feels generic, rehearsed—advice I could’ve read in a book. A manager at work making an uninformed decision that affects me directly. In those moments, the thought creeps in: *Why am I supposed to submit when I know better?*  

I wrestle with the dissonance. *Is submission about acknowledging truth, or about acknowledging position?* What if the person in authority doesn’t deserve it? Shouldn’t competence matter more than hierarchy? But then I remember Romans 12: *“Outdo one another in showing honor.”* Honor doesn’t mean agreement. It doesn’t mean silence, either. Maybe it means resisting the urge to roll my eyes, to dismantle their credibility in my head, to win the argument—spoken or unspoken.  

Still, the tension lingers. *What if they’re just wrong? What if I could do it better?* The questions gnaw at me, but I’m beginning to see that submission isn’t about rewarding competence. It’s about trust—not in them, but in God.  

Still, *how do I honor authorities I distrust?* In my Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS), the professor was discussing a required reading—one that was clearly radical in its stance on feminism and racial equity. Instead of critically engaging with its extremity, he took a roundabout way of affirming it, and naturally, the rest of the class followed suit. Maybe that’s just how things are these days. I sat there, listening, but mostly brewing.  

I wanted to push back, to ask questions that would challenge the assumptions being made. But I didn’t. Not out of fear, necessarily—just exhaustion. Would speaking up change anything? Or would it just make me the odd one out, the one who doesn’t get it? David Powlison’s words echoed in my mind: *“You are essentially Child, Slave, and Wife to Christ first.”* My submission, I realized, flows upward—to God—before extending horizontally. That doesn’t mean agreeing, and it doesn’t mean silence either. Maybe it just means letting go of the need to win.  

I don’t know if my silence was wisdom or cowardice. Maybe I should have spoken up. Maybe I should have found a way to articulate my thoughts in a way that was both firm and gracious. Or maybe submission, in that moment, looked like restraint—not because I agreed, but because I trusted that my obedience to God matters more than proving a point.  

On a slight tangent, marriage still daunts me. I get that family structure matters, that leadership isn’t about power but responsibility. But still, I picture a future where my hypothetical wife and I clash over finances or parenting, and I hesitate. What if I get it wrong? What if leadership feels more like weight than wisdom?

Opting out sounds easier, but Scripture doesn’t leave that open. Husbands are called to lead—not as tyrants, but as shepherds, bearing responsibility with love. Piper’s image of Sarah calling Abraham “lord” with a lowercase _l_ reframes it: my ultimate allegiance is to the capital-_L_ Lord. Leadership isn’t about control; it’s about trust. Submission, then, isn’t a shackle—it’s a safeguard, a way to navigate human brokenness while anchored in divine truth.

Some days, I still white-knuckle my will. Old habits die hard. But I’m learning that humility isn’t about shrinking; it’s about reorienting. Like a vine clinging to a trellis, submission channels my growth upward, toward the light. And when I resist—when I itch to argue or control—I return to Ephesians 5:21, where mutual submission is an act of reverence, not resignation. There’s freedom in bending, I’m starting to see. The trellis holds.
