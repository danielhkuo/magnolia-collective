## 1. Meaning of "Gospel"

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP)         | - Primarily about personal salvation<br>- Focuses on individual escaping divine punishment<br>- Emphasizes vertical relationship with God<br>- Often reduced to "Jesus died for your sins"                                                                                               |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Big, cosmic story about redemption of all creation<br>- Emphasizes God's faithfulness to covenant promises<br>- Includes societal and creation-wide implications<br>- Focuses on Jesus as Lord over all creation                                                                       |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Combines aspects of both OPP and NPP<br>- "Gospel from the air": Cosmic story of redemption<br>- "Gospel from the land": Personal salvation<br>- Includes both "gospel announcement" (big picture) and "gospel call" (individual response)<br>- Balances individual and cosmic aspects |

## 2. Meaning of "the righteousness of God is revealed"

| Perspective | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | Two main interpretations:<br>1. God's general righteous character<br>2. Imputed righteousness transferred to believers<br>- Focuses on God's moral perfection<br>- Emphasizes legal/forensic aspects |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | - God's covenant faithfulness<br>- Specifically, His fulfillment of promises to Israel<br>- Focuses on God's actions in history<br>- Emphasizes relational aspects of God's character |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees more with NPP<br>- Emphasizes covenant faithfulness<br>- Maintains some aspects of God's moral perfection<br>- Seeks to balance forensic and relational aspects |

## 3. Role of personal works in final justification

| Perspective | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | - Works are only evidence of salvation, not the basis<br>- Justification is entirely based on Christ's work<br>- Good works are inevitable result of true faith<br>- Emphasizes "alien righteousness" |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | - On judgment day, positive works must align with new covenant principles<br>- Whole life lived must follow new covenant stipulations<br>- Works play a role in maintaining covenant membership<br>- Emphasizes obedience and covenant faithfulness |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Works are only evidence, not the basis of justification<br>- Living according to the new covenant is important but not the basis<br>- Maintains emphasis on Christ's work as sole basis<br>- Seeks to balance grace and obedience |

## 4. How faith is counted as righteousness (Ordo Salutis)

| Perspective | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | Calvinistic view:<br>- Faith is not a work<br>- Faith unites believers to Christ<br>- God declares believer righteous because faith hides them in Christ<br>- Emphasizes monergism (God's sole action in salvation) |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | Arminian-leaning view:<br>- Faith is a work, albeit a minimal one<br>- God graciously lowered the bar to this one act of faith<br>- Faith is the basis for declaring righteousness<br>- Tends towards synergism (cooperation between God and humans) |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees more with OPP's Calvinistic view<br>- Emphasizes faith as a gift from God<br>- Maintains monergistic understanding of salvation<br>- Seeks to balance divine sovereignty and human responsibility |

## 5. Definition of "justification"

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP)         | - Being forgiven in a one-on-one, personal relationship with God<br>- Primarily vertical dimension<br>- Forensic declaration of righteousness<br>- Often linked closely with imputation of Christ's righteousness                                                                                                                                                    |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Being declared part of the covenant community<br>- Emphasizes horizontal, communal dimension<br>- More about covenant membership than personal forgiveness<br>- Often linked with Jewish law court metaphors                                                                                                                                                       |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Like an adoption court declaration<br>- Both vertical (relationship with God) and horizontal (relationship with other believers) implications<br>- Ongoing debate within HRP:<br>  1. Vertical first, then horizontal<br>  2. Horizontal first, then vertical<br>  3. Simultaneous vertical and horizontal<br>- Seeks to integrate forensic and relational aspects |

## 6. Meaning of "works of the law"

| Perspective | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | - Refers to moral effort<br>- Not saved by showing God your moral righteousness |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | - Specific to Jewish works of the law<br>- Not saved by circumcision, Sabbath, or kosher practices |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees with John Barclay<br>- Not saved by offering any form of social capital to God<br>- In this case, Jewish practices, but could be any culturally valued behaviors |

## 7. Understanding of "charis" (grace)

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP)         | - Unmerited favor<br>- God's kindness to us that we don't deserve                                                                                           |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Doing a favor<br>- Implies an expectation of returning the favor                                                                                          |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees with John Barclay<br>- Unmerited favor that implicitly establishes a relationship<br>- Accepting grace means entering into a relationship with God |

## 8. Translation of "pistis Christou"

| Perspective | Translation | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | "Faith in Christ" | - Emphasizes the believer's faith as the instrument of salvation<br>- Views 'Christou' as an objective genitive (Christ as object of faith)<br>- Aligns with traditional Protestant emphasis on sola fide<br>- Sees this as consistent with Paul's emphasis on believing in Christ |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | "Faithfulness of Christ" | - Emphasizes Christ's own faithfulness to God's covenant<br>- Views 'Christou' as a subjective genitive (Christ as subject of faithfulness)<br>- Focuses on Christ's obedience and loyalty to God's plan<br>- Connects to NPP's emphasis on covenant and Jesus as faithful Israelite |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | "Faith in Christ" | - Agrees with OPP's translation<br>- Maintains emphasis on individual's faith in Christ<br>- May acknowledge some merit in NPP's view but sees it as less central<br>- Seeks to balance Christ's faithfulness and our faith in Him |

## 9. Single or Double Imputation

| Perspective                           | Interpretation    | Detailed Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP)         | Double Imputation | - Believes in both negative and positive imputation:<br>1. Negative: Our sins are imputed (credited) to Christ on the cross.<br>2. Positive: Christ's active righteousness (His perfect life of obedience) is imputed to believers.<br>- This means believers are not only forgiven but also positively righteous in God's sight.<br>- Often associated with the idea of Christ's "active" and "passive" obedience.<br>- Emphasizes that salvation includes both freedom from punishment and the positive status of righteousness.<br>- Sees this as necessary for full justification before a holy God. |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | Single Imputation | - Generally focuses on single, negative imputation:<br>1. Our sins are imputed to Christ on the cross.<br>- Does not typically emphasize the imputation of Christ's active righteousness to believers.<br>- Often views righteousness more in terms of covenant membership or status rather than moral perfection.<br>- May see positive righteousness as something believers grow into through the work of the Holy Spirit rather than receiving it immediately through imputation.<br>- Tends to emphasize participation in Christ over imputation of His righteousness.                               |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | Double Imputation | - Agrees with the Old Perspective on double imputation<br>- Emphasizes that believers are declared perfectly righteous in God's sight at the moment of justification.<br>- Views this as essential for assurance of salvation and standing before God.<br>- Often connects this to the idea of "union with Christ," through which believers receive all the benefits of His work.<br>- May also emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in applying this imputed righteousness to the believer's life.                                                                                                     |

## 10. Best synonym for "pistis" (faith)

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP)         | - Trust                                                         |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Allegiance (implying a kingly, royal, whole-body commitment)  |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees more with NPP<br>- Leans towards allegiance over trust |

## 11. Primary source for the gospel message

| Perspective | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Old Perspective on Paul (OPP) | - Book of Romans (and to a lesser extent, Galatians)<br>- Focus on where the message of salvation is most clearly explained |
| New Perspective on Paul (NPP) | - The four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John)<br>- Paul's letters apply the gospel to specific situations |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees more with NPP<br>- Emphasizes the Gospels, but acknowledges debate on this issue |

## 12. Purpose of the Book of Romans

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                          |

| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Manifesto for ecclesial unity<br>- Focuses on unity within the body of believers                                                                                                      |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Agrees more with NPP on ecclesial unity<br>- But sees Romans as more doctrinal and universal than other letters<br>- Appropriate for answering theological and evangelistic questions |

## 13. Sufficiency of Scripture vs. Historical Background

| Perspective                           | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| New Perspective on Paul (NPP)         | - Emphasizes need for historical background<br>- Accepts that some passages may be lost to history and cannot be fully understood                                                                                                                                    |
| Historical Reformed Perspective (HRP) | - Leans towards NPP but with caveats<br>- Accepts some passages may be unclear due to lost historical context<br>- Argues that all theologically important passages can be understood<br>- Notes that historical work sometimes confirms traditional interpretations |
