# Young Earth Creationism–A Controversial Perspective
## Overview of Young Earth Creationism (YEC)
Young Earth Creationism (YEC) posits that Earth was created **6,000 to 10,000 years ago**, based on a literal interpretation of the Bible. This view gained prominence in the 20th century through figures like **[Henry Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_M._Morris)**[^1] and **John C. Whitcomb Jr.**, who co-authored *The Genesis Flood* (1961)[^2]. Their work revitalized earlier ideas from **George McCready Price**’s *The New Geology* (1923)[^3], which dismissed mainstream geology in favor of Biblical literalism. Critics, including Christian scholars **Bernard Ramm**[^4] and geologist **J. Laurence Kulp**[^5], challenged Price’s lack of empirical rigor in the 1950s.  

Morris and Whitcomb’s *The Genesis Flood* faced similar scrutiny. Organizations like the **[National Center for Science Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Science_Education)**[^6] accused them of misquoting sources—even altering “**million years**” to “**years**” in one instance[^6]. Their claims, deemed unscientific due to selective evidence use, spurred the founding of the **[Institute for Creation Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Creation_Research)**[^1].

## Geological Disputes: Thrust Faults
YEC arguments often misinterpret geological processes. Morris and Whitcomb claimed that **thrust faults**—fractures where older rock layers override younger ones—disprove conventional geology. Geologist **John G. Solum** refuted this, explaining thrust faults result from tectonic compression and do not rely on fossil dating[^7].  

### Key Misconceptions:
- **Principle of Superposition**: YEC claims of circular reasoning in rock dating were countered by independently verifiable principles like superposition (younger layers atop older ones) and cross-cutting relationships[^8].
- **Igneous/Metamorphic Rocks**: Thrust faults in non-fossil-bearing rocks contradict YEC assertions that fossils dictate dating[^7].

## Debating Radiometric Dating
Between 1997 and 2005, the **RATE project** by the Institute for Creation Research sought to challenge radiometric dating. While acknowledging **500 million years’ worth of decay**, they proposed accelerated nuclear decay during Biblical events[^9]. Independent experts identified flaws, such as ignoring heat generated by rapid decay—enough to melt Earth’s crust[^10][^11][^12].

## Scientific Consensus and Legal Rebuttals
In 2006, **68 global science academies** reaffirmed Earth’s age (**4.5 billion years**) and evolution as settled science, supported by multidisciplinary evidence[^13][^14][^15][^16]. YEC claims of academic censorship were dismissed in *McLean v. Arkansas* (1981), where no proof of suppressed research emerged[^17].  

> **Henry Morris** warned: *"Christians who flirt with less-than-literal readings of biblical texts are also flirting with theological disaster."*[^1]
