# An Analysis of the Most Popular Reconciliations of Salvation, God’s Sovereignty, and Omniscience
One of the great theological tensions in Christianity is how to reconcile **God’s sovereignty, human responsibility, and the certainty of salvation**. Throughout history, various theological traditions have attempted to resolve this dilemma. Some prioritize **biblical faithfulness over logical consistency**, while others **push deeper into philosophical reasoning** to create a fully cohesive system.

In this analysis, we will evaluate the [[Theology Corner/An Analysis of the Most Popular Reconciliations of Salvation, God’s Sovereignty, and Omniscience#The Lutheran View\|Lutheran]], [[Theology Corner/An Analysis of the Most Popular Reconciliations of Salvation, God’s Sovereignty, and Omniscience#The Calvinist/Reformed View\|Calvinist]], [[Theology Corner/An Analysis of the Most Popular Reconciliations of Salvation, God’s Sovereignty, and Omniscience#The Wesleyan-Arminian View\|Arminian]], and [[Theology Corner/An Analysis of the Most Popular Reconciliations of Salvation, God’s Sovereignty, and Omniscience#Molinism Maximum Philosophical Precision, Maximum Speculation\|Molinist]] approaches to this issue—highlighting both their strengths and weaknesses.

# The Lutheran View

Lutheran theology is often regarded as **the most straightforward reading of Scripture**, refusing to force logical conclusions beyond what is clearly revealed in the Bible. This approach prioritizes **biblical consistency over philosophical resolution**.

## What the Lutheran View Teaches

### 1. Divine Sovereignty & Human Responsibility in Paradox

- **Affirms predestination (Romans 8:29-30)**—God unconditionally elects some to salvation.
- **Also affirms universal grace (1 Timothy 2:4)**—God desires all people to be saved.
- **Holds humans accountable (John 3:18-19)**—those who reject God are truly responsible.
- However, **Lutheranism does not attempt to reconcile these paradoxes rationally**—it simply **lets them stand.**

### 2. Avoids Hyper-Calvinism

- Unlike Reformed theology, Lutheranism **rejects equal ultimacy**, the idea that election and reprobation are symmetrical.
- Instead, it holds that **salvation is an active work of God**, but **damnation is a result of God passing over the non-elect**, rather than actively turning them away.
- Just as God **passed over the Jewish houses during the first Passover**, Lutheranism sees God **passing over the reprobate**, rather than actively reprobating them.
- This is a key distinction—Lutheranism insists that **God alone is responsible for salvation, but humans alone are responsible for damnation**.

### 3. Faith Is a Gift, Yet Some Resist

- Faith is purely a work of God (Ephesians 2:8-9).
- Yet, **some people resist grace and remain condemned**, though it’s not fully explained why.
- Lutheranism holds that this rejection is due to **human sinfulness**, but it does not attempt to explain **why some resist while others do not**.

## Strengths of the Lutheran View

✅ **Scriptural Consistency**

- Unlike other systems, Lutheranism does not attempt to "smooth over" difficult texts. It **affirms both election and universal grace** without attempting to philosophically synthesize them.

✅ **Avoids Hyper-Calvinism and Equal Ultimacy**

- Calvinism struggles with the **moral difficulty of reprobation**—particularly when interpreted through the lens of **equal ultimacy**, the idea that God actively reprobates people in the same way He elects them.
- Lutheranism **avoids this problem** by emphasizing that those who are lost are lost by their own rejection—not by God's active work.

✅ **Holds to a Christ-Centered Gospel**

- The emphasis remains on **grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone** without turning salvation into an abstract philosophical system.
- Lutheranism remains highly **pastoral**—it **assures believers of God’s love** without burdening them with extreme theological speculation.

---

## Problems with the Lutheran View

Despite its **faithfulness to the biblical text**, Lutheranism **creates unresolved tensions** that **some argue must be addressed**.

### 1. Does Embracing Paradox Avoid Necessary Theological Resolution?

- Lutheranism **accepts tension rather than resolving it**—but at what point does that **become avoidance rather than faithfulness**?
- If **Scripture presents apparent contradictions**, should we attempt to reconcile them or leave them unexplained?
- **Example:**
    - God’s will is **irresistible** (Daniel 4:35, Romans 9:19), yet **some resist salvation** (Matthew 23:37).
    - How do these truths coexist without contradiction? Lutheranism **offers no explanation**—it simply calls it a **mystery**.

### 2. The Problem of God’s Will and Rejection of Grace

- **Lutheranism affirms that God truly desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4).**
- **But if God’s will is ultimately unstoppable, how is it that some are not saved?**
- Calvinism resolves this by arguing that **God does not truly desire all to be saved in the same way**—but Lutheranism refuses to take that step.
- The Lutheran response is **"We don’t know—it’s a paradox."**
    - But is this an **acceptable theological answer**, or is it simply **dodging a difficult issue**?

### 3. Why Do Some Resist If Faith Is a Gift?

- **If salvation is purely God’s work, why do some reject it while others accept?**
- If faith is a **gift of God**, then **shouldn’t everyone given this gift believe?**
- Lutheranism **does not provide a theological mechanism** for why some resist and others don’t—it simply **accepts that they do**.
- The risk here is that **without a deeper explanation, the system seems incomplete**.

## Final Verdict on Lutheranism

### What It Gets Right

✔️ **Most faithful to the biblical text**—affirms both God’s sovereignty and human accountability.  
✔️ **Pastorally comforting**—assures believers without extreme philosophical speculation.  
✔️ **Avoids Calvinism’s harsh determinism**—does not make God the author of evil.

### Where It Falls Short

❌ **Leaves paradox unresolved**—at some point, embracing mystery might become avoidance.  
❌ **Struggles to explain why some resist grace**—faith is God’s work, yet some reject it for reasons unexplained.  
❌ **Doesn’t fully answer the problem of God’s will**—If God’s will is sovereign, how can His saving will be resisted?

### Conclusion

While **Lutheran theology remains deeply biblical**, it does not fully **resolve the logical implications** of its doctrines. It is **the most textually consistent** but arguably **the least systematically complete**.

This leads some to take **one logical step forward** into **Calvinism**, which resolves these tensions—albeit at the cost of some **difficult moral conclusions**.

---

### Where Do We Go From Here?

If Lutheranism is **biblically consistent** but **logically incomplete**, is there a more **satisfying theological system**?

In the next sections, we will examine:

- **Calvinism** – Does it solve the problems of Lutheranism, or does it create new ones?
- **Arminianism** – Does it offer a more coherent middle ground, or does it fall into Semi-Pelagianism?
- **Molinism** – Can philosophy help resolve the problem, or does it overcomplicate things?

# The Calvinist/Reformed View

The Calvinist position is often seen as **the logical extension of the Lutheran view**—taking the doctrine of **monergistic salvation** (God alone saves) and applying it to **the entire scope of human destiny**. Where Lutheranism leaves paradoxes unexplained, Calvinism insists that **all things—both salvation and damnation—fall under God's sovereign decree**.

This results in a theological system that is **logically rigorous** and **internally consistent**, but also **raises serious moral and philosophical challenges**. While it offers the **clearest explanation of divine sovereignty**, it can also **make God seem unapproachable, even harsh**.

---

## What the Calvinist View Teaches

### 1. It Takes God's Sovereignty Seriously

- God is **absolutely sovereign**—everything happens according to His divine will.
- **Isaiah 46:10** – "I declare the end from the beginning... My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose."
- **Ephesians 1:11** – "In Him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will."
- If **God's will is supreme**, then human choices must be **subordinate to His decree**.

### 2. It Resolves the Lutheran "Mystery"

- Lutheranism holds that **God desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4)**, yet **not all are saved**—and simply calls this a **mystery**.
- Calvinism **rejects unresolved paradox** and logically concludes that **if God willed for all to be saved, all would be saved**.
- Thus, **God's will to save must be specific and particular**—it applies only to **the elect** (Romans 9:19-23).

### 3. It Best Explains Biblical Election

- God's choice is **not based on foreseen faith** but on **His sovereign will alone**.
- **John 15:16** – "You did not choose me, but I chose you."
- **Romans 8:29-30** – "For those whom He foreknew He also predestined..."
- The elect are chosen **before creation** (Ephesians 1:4-5), meaning their faith is **a result of God's choice, not the cause of it**.

### 4. It Upholds the Sufficiency of Christ’s Work

- If Christ **died for all equally**, yet some are still lost, then **His atonement failed to accomplish its purpose**.
- But if Christ died **specifically and effectively for His people**, then **His work actually saves 100% of those intended**.
- **John 10:11** – "The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
- This is the doctrine of **limited atonement**—Christ’s death was **sufficient for all** but **efficient only for the elect**.

### 5. It Matches Biblical Examples of God's Hardening

- The Bible **explicitly states** that God **actively hardened Pharaoh's heart** (Exodus 9:12, Romans 9:17).
- **John 12:39-40** – Some Jews **could not believe** because God blinded them.
- **Romans 9:18** – "So then He has mercy on whomever He wills, and He hardens whomever He wills."
- Calvinism affirms that **God is active, not passive, in both election and reprobation**.

---

## Problems with the Calvinist View

While Calvinism **successfully resolves the logical tensions of Lutheranism**, it introduces a new set of **moral and theological difficulties**.

### 1. Does This Make God "Harsh"?

- The doctrine of **election and reprobation** can make God **seem cruel**.
- **Some are chosen for eternal life**, while **others are left in their sin and judgment**.
- If **God could save all but chooses not to**, isn’t He **less loving than He claims to be**?
- **1 John 4:8** – "God is love."
- If **love is central to God's nature**, then **why wouldn’t He save all if He has the power to do so?**

### 2. Is the "We’re Too Sinful to Understand" Argument a Cop-Out?

- Many Calvinists respond to objections by saying, **"Who are you, O man, to answer back to God?"** (Romans 9:20).
- While it’s true that God’s wisdom is beyond human comprehension, shouldn’t His justice be **at least somewhat understandable**?
- If God's justice **seems indistinguishable from injustice**, is that a **failure of human reason or a flaw in the theological system**?

### 3. Does "Passive Reprobation" Actually Avoid Equal Ultimacy?

Most Calvinists **reject equal ultimacy** (the idea that God ordains election and reprobation in the same way). Instead, they make this distinction:

- **Election is active** – God **chooses some** for salvation.
- **Reprobation is passive** – God **passes over** the non-elect, allowing them to continue in their sin.

But is this **really different** from equal ultimacy?

- **If God chooses to save some, He necessarily chooses not to save others.**
- **The absence of election is still a decree**—choosing not to intervene **is still a choice**.
- **If God’s choice determines salvation, then His non-choice determines damnation.**

### 4. The Problem of the Reprobate’s Existence

- **If God truly desires His own glory, why create people He knows will never be saved?**
- Some Calvinists argue that God created the reprobate **to display His justice** (Romans 9:22-23).
- But this raises a disturbing question:
    - **Are the reprobate simply "props" in God's cosmic display of justice?**
    - **Does their existence serve no greater purpose than to be condemned?**
    - If so, how does that align with the idea that **God is good**?

### 5. The Problem of Love and Divine Will

- **Does God love the non-elect?**
    - If **God is love (1 John 4:8)**, then wouldn’t He love **all people equally**?
    - Yet, if **He only saves the elect**, then **His love is not universal in the saving sense**.
- Calvinists respond by saying:
    - God has a **general love for all** (common grace).
    - But He has **a special, salvific love only for the elect**.
    - However, this **raises a problem**:
        - **If God's highest form of love is salvation, then those He does not save are not truly "loved" in the fullest sense.**
        - **How can we say God "desires all to be saved" (1 Timothy 2:4) if He only gives saving grace to some?**

---

## Final Verdict on Calvinism

### What It Gets Right

✔️ **Logically rigorous**—provides a complete, consistent system.  
✔️ **Takes sovereignty seriously**—nothing happens outside of God's will.  
✔️ **Explains election biblically**—makes sense of predestination passages.  
✔️ **Upholds the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement**—His work actually secures salvation.

### Where It Falls Short

❌ **Can make God seem harsh**—choosing some while passing over others.  
❌ **Raises serious moral questions**—how can God be all-loving yet only save some? 
❌ **The distinction between active and passive reprobation is unclear**—does God simply “permit” the lost to reject Him, or is He **actively ordaining their rejection**?  
❌ **The reprobate’s existence seems troubling**—if they were never going to be saved, why create them at all?

### Conclusion

- Calvinism is **the most logically complete** system—it leaves no theological tension unresolved.
- But this **logical completeness comes at a cost**: it raises **serious moral and emotional challenges**.
- Many Christians **accept it intellectually** but **struggle with its implications**.

---

### Where Do We Go From Here?

If **Calvinism resolves Lutheranism’s mystery but raises moral dilemmas**, is there a better alternative?

Next, we will analyze:

- **Arminianism** – Does it provide a stronger moral framework, or does it make salvation dependent on human effort?
- **Molinism** – Can counterfactual logic help, or does it go too far into philosophy?

Stay tuned for the next installment: **The Arminian View – Maximum Human Responsibility, Maximum Divine Accommodation.**

# The Wesleyan-Arminian View

Building on the **foundations of Reformed thought and Calvinism**, Arminianism seeks to **preserve both God's love and human responsibility**. It rejects the **harsh determinism of Calvinism** and the **mystical paradox of Lutheranism**, emphasizing **God’s universal desire for salvation and the necessity of human free will** in responding to His grace.

The Wesleyan-Arminian tradition, associated with **John Wesley and later Methodism**, goes further than classical Arminianism by **placing a stronger emphasis on holiness and the possibility of falling from grace**. However, at its core, Arminianism as a whole is appealing because:

✅ **It is intuitive and feels good!**  
✅ **It upholds the idea that God’s love extends equally to all.**  
✅ **It maintains moral accountability—people freely choose salvation or rejection.**

If God truly **desires all to be saved**, then it makes sense that He would **give everyone a genuine opportunity** to accept or reject Him. **Arminianism attempts to balance God’s sovereignty with human freedom, creating a theologically attractive position.**

---

## What the Wesleyan-Arminian View Teaches

### 1. God's Universal Love & Desire for All to Be Saved

- God **sincerely desires the salvation of every person** (1 Timothy 2:4, 2 Peter 3:9, Ezekiel 33:11).
- Jesus' atonement was **universal**—He died for **all people, not just the elect** (1 John 2:2, Hebrews 2:9).
- Salvation is genuinely **offered to everyone**, ensuring that **no one is excluded from grace arbitrarily**.

### 2. Free Will & Prevenient Grace

- Because of **original sin**, humans **cannot seek God on their own** (Romans 3:10-12).
- However, **prevenient grace** (grace that “goes before”) **enables all people** to respond to God’s call (John 1:9, Titus 2:11).
- **Grace does not force a response**—humans must **freely choose** to accept or reject salvation.

### 3. Conditional Election

- Unlike Calvinism, where election is **unconditional**, Arminianism teaches **God elects based on foreseen faith** (Romans 8:29).
- God **knows in advance who will believe** and elects them accordingly.
- Election is **corporate as well as individual**—those who believe become part of **God’s chosen people (the Church)**.

### 4. Resistible Grace & the Role of Free Will

- Unlike **Calvinist irresistible grace**, Arminians believe **God’s grace can be rejected** (Acts 7:51, Matthew 23:37).
- Salvation is **offered to all, but not all will accept it**.
- This ensures that **love is freely chosen, not coerced**—which Arminians argue is essential to true relationship with God.

### 5. Conditional Security (Some Hold to It)

- While some Arminians believe in **eternal security**, Wesleyans hold that **salvation can be lost** through persistent unbelief or sin (Hebrews 6:4-6, 2 Peter 2:20-22).
- The believer must **continue in faith** (Philippians 2:12-13).

---

## Strengths of the Wesleyan-Arminian View

✅ **It Best Reflects God's Loving Character**

- God is **love** (1 John 4:8), and love must be **freely chosen**—not predestined.
- Arminianism ensures that **everyone has a fair and genuine opportunity** to be saved.

✅ **It Maintains Human Moral Responsibility**

- Unlike **Calvinism, where human choices are predetermined**, Arminianism ensures that **humans are genuinely responsible** for their rejection of God (John 3:18).
- This aligns with the **consistent biblical call to repentance and faith**.

✅ **It Avoids the Problem of Equal Ultimacy**

- **Unlike hyper-Calvinism, where God actively reprobates people**, Arminianism teaches that **damnation is entirely the result of human rejection, not divine decree**.
- God does not **force anyone into unbelief**, but rather **permits it** as a consequence of human free will.

✅ **It Gives Evangelism Real Meaning**

- If **God’s grace is resistible**, then preaching the gospel truly **matters**—salvation **depends on whether people choose to respond**.
- This contrasts with **Calvinism**, where evangelism is simply the means by which God calls the already-elect.

---

## Problems with the Wesleyan-Arminian View

Despite its **moral appeal**, Arminianism **still encounters deep theological and logical difficulties**.

### 1. Does It Really Avoid Calvinism’s Problem of Reprobation?

👉 **If God could save all but doesn’t, how is this different from Calvinism?**

- Calvinists say **God elects some and not others**.
- Arminians say **God offers salvation to all but allows some to reject it**.
- **In both cases, God permits people to go to hell when He could guarantee their salvation.**
- This means **Arminians must admit** that **God’s highest priority is not saving everyone, but preserving free will.**

### 2. If God Knows Who Will Reject Him, Why Create Them?

👉 **If God foreknows that certain people will reject Him, why does He still create them?**

- Arminians claim God **elects people based on foreseen faith** (Romans 8:29).
- But if He already knows some **will reject Him**, why allow them to be born?
- **The same problem applies to Calvinism:**
    - If **God knows and allows people to be damned**, isn’t He **still responsible**?
    - He could have **chosen not to create them at all** but **does so anyway**.
    - Thus, **Arminianism does not escape the problem of God creating people destined for hell**.

### 3. If Faith Is Our Choice, Does Salvation Depend on Us?

👉 **Does this make salvation partly a human achievement?**

- Arminians say **faith is a response to grace, not a work**.
- But if **God gives everyone the same prevenient grace**, why do some believe while others reject?
    - Is one person **smarter? More moral? More humble?**
- If **the answer is anything but God’s grace**, then salvation becomes **partly based on human effort**, contradicting **Ephesians 2:8-9** ("not of works").
- If **grace enables all equally, but some respond differently**, then salvation ultimately depends on **man’s choice**, not **God’s will (John 1:12-13).**

### 4. If Jesus Died for All, Why Are Some Still Lost?

👉 **Does universal atonement weaken the power of the cross?**

- Arminians affirm that **Jesus died for all** (1 John 2:2).
- But if **Jesus’ death applies to all, yet some are not saved**, does this mean His atonement **failed**?
- Calvinists argue that Jesus **actually secured** salvation for the elect, whereas Arminianism makes the atonement **merely potential**, dependent on human response.
- This **undermines the sufficiency of the cross**, making salvation **contingent on man’s acceptance rather than God’s decree**.

---

## Final Verdict on Arminianism

### What It Gets Right

✔️ **Best upholds God's love**—salvation is genuinely available to all.  
✔️ **Preserves human responsibility**—people freely accept or reject Christ.  
✔️ **Avoids the problem of equal ultimacy**—damnation is purely a human choice.

### Where It Falls Short

❌ **Still allows people to be created who will certainly reject God**—just like Calvinism.  
❌ **Faith becomes the ultimate deciding factor in salvation**—making it partly a human effort.  
❌ **Atonement is weakened**—Christ’s death does not secure salvation, only makes it possible.

### Conclusion

Arminianism **feels morally and intuitively right**, but when scrutinized, it **fails to fully explain God's sovereignty and human responsibility**. It successfully **avoids the harshness of Calvinism**, but in doing so, **creates its own set of theological contradictions**.

---

### Where Do We Go From Here?

If **Arminianism preserves free will but weakens sovereignty**, is there a more complete alternative?

# Molinism

Molinism seeks to reconcile **divine sovereignty with human free will** in a way that avoids the **determinism of Calvinism** and the **human-centered focus of Arminianism**. It attempts to provide a **cohesive explanation** of how God can be **completely in control** of history while **allowing for genuine libertarian free will**.

The heart of Molinism is **God’s middle knowledge (scientia media)**—a concept that allows God to **sovereignly control all events** while still **preserving human choice**.

---

## What Molinism Teaches

### 1. The Three Types of Divine Knowledge

Molinism distinguishes between three **logical moments** in God’s knowledge:

1. **Natural Knowledge** (What could happen)
    
    - God knows **all necessary truths** (e.g., math, logic, what is possible).
2. **Middle Knowledge** (What would happen)
    
    - God knows what **any free creature would do** in any given situation (**counterfactuals**).
3. **Free Knowledge** (What will happen)
    
    - God knows **the actual future**, based on **His sovereign decision** to create a specific world.

---

### 2. How God Sovereignly Chooses a World with Free Choices

- God does not **determine every choice** like in Calvinism.
- Instead, He knows **how every free creature would respond** in any possible scenario.
- He then **actualizes the world** that **best accomplishes His ultimate purposes** while still allowing for **libertarian free will**.

**Key Idea:** God is not a **deterministic ruler** who predestines all actions, nor is He a **passive observer**—instead, He is a **strategic planner** who creates a world where His goals are accomplished through **genuine free decisions**.

---

### 3. Counterfactuals & Free Will

- Before creating the world, **God knew** that if **Person A** were placed in **Situation X**, they would freely choose **Outcome Y**.
- God **uses this knowledge** to arrange history in such a way that **His plans are fulfilled without violating free will**.

📌 **Example: Pharaoh’s Hardened Heart**

- God **did not force Pharaoh to reject Him**.
- Instead, God knew that **Pharaoh would freely choose to harden his heart under certain conditions**.
- So, God **placed Pharaoh in those exact conditions**, ensuring the Exodus happened **without coercion**.

---

### 4. Salvation & Middle Knowledge

- **God desires all to be saved** (1 Timothy 2:4), but He also **knows who would freely accept or reject His grace**.
- He **creates a world where the maximum number of people freely choose salvation**, while still **allowing for human rejection**.
- This **preserves God's universal love** while **maintaining human responsibility**.

📌 **Example: Why Was Jesus Crucified Under Pilate?**

- God **knew Pilate would freely choose to condemn Jesus** under certain circumstances.
- God **orchestrated history** so that Pilate would be in power **at that exact moment**, ensuring Christ’s crucifixion without **coercion**.

---

### Strengths of the Molinist View

✅ **It Maximizes Both Divine Sovereignty & Human Free Will**

- Unlike **Calvinism**, it **does not override free will**.
- Unlike **Arminianism**, it **keeps God in complete control of history**.

✅ **It Solves the Problem of Evil Without Making God the Author of Sin**

- Calvinism struggles with **God actively ordaining evil**.
- Arminianism struggles with **God allowing evil without a clear purpose**.
- Molinism allows for a **world where free creatures commit evil, but God orchestrates events so that ultimate good results** (Genesis 50:20, Romans 8:28).

✅ **It Explains Difficult Biblical Passages**

- **Pharaoh’s hardened heart**: God **did not force Pharaoh to resist**; He simply **placed Pharaoh in a situation where He knew Pharaoh would freely resist** (Exodus 9:12).
- **Judas’ betrayal**: Judas **wasn’t programmed to betray Jesus**, but God **knew Judas would freely choose to do so** if placed in a position of discipleship (John 6:70-71).
- **Salvation and evangelism**: God knows who **would freely believe**, so He **arranges history** so that **people who would respond positively are given the best opportunities** (Acts 17:26-27).

✅ **It Avoids the Harshness of Calvinism & the Uncertainty of Arminianism**

- Unlike **Calvinism**, **God does not unconditionally elect people to hell**.
- Unlike **Arminianism**, God’s **plan is not dependent on chance**—He knows **precisely how things will turn out**.

---

## Problems with the Molinist View

### 1. The Bible Teaches God's Foreknowledge, but Does It Teach "Middle Knowledge"?

👉 **Is Molinism based on philosophy rather than biblical exegesis?**

- **Romans 8:29** speaks of **foreknowledge**, but nowhere does the Bible **explicitly** teach middle knowledge.
- **1 Samuel 23:10-13** and **Matthew 11:21-23** suggest God knows **counterfactuals**, but they do not describe **middle knowledge as a logical category**.
- **Molinism is built more on philosophical reasoning than on clear biblical teaching**.

---

### 2. Does Middle Knowledge Actually Preserve Free Will?

👉 **If God chooses a world based on how people "would" freely act, is that truly freedom?**

- If God **only creates worlds where people make certain choices**, then He is still **determining outcomes—just indirectly**.
- It’s still a form of **predestination, just with extra steps**.
- The person **cannot actually do otherwise** because **God already chose a world in which they would act in a specific way**.

---

### 3. Why Would God Create People He Knows Will Reject Him?

👉 **If God truly desires all to be saved, why create people He knows will never choose Him?**

- This is the **same issue as Calvinism and Arminianism**:
    - **Calvinism:** God **could save all but doesn’t**.
    - **Arminianism:** God **could prevent some from being born but doesn’t**.
    - **Molinism:** God **knows exactly who would reject Him, but He still creates them anyway**.
- If love is God’s primary attribute (**1 John 4:8**), why create people **He knows are doomed to reject Him?**

---

### 4. Does Molinism Go Beyond What the Bible Reveals?

👉 **Does it impose a complex philosophical system onto Scripture?**

- The Bible presents **God’s knowledge as absolute and uncaused**—not as God **picking between potential worlds**.
- Molinism relies on **counterfactual logic** that the Bible **never discusses**.
- It assumes that **free will means libertarian freedom** (the ability to do otherwise), but Scripture often presents people **acting according to their nature** (John 8:34, Romans 6:20).

---

### 5. The Problem of the Best Possible World

👉 **If God can choose among infinite possible worlds, why didn’t He create one where everyone is saved?**

- If **some people in every possible world reject Him**, then God is **limited in His power**.
- If God **could create a world where everyone is saved but didn’t**, then He doesn’t **truly desire all to be saved**.
- **Molinism tries to solve the problem of evil but ends up restating it in a different form.**

---

## Final Verdict on Molinism

### What It Gets Right

✔️ **Best attempt at reconciling sovereignty and free will.**  
✔️ **Explains some difficult biblical passages.**  
✔️ **Avoids making God the author of sin.**

### Where It Falls Short

❌ **Not explicitly taught in Scripture.**  
❌ **Still allows for people being created who are doomed to reject God.**  
❌ **Turns free will into an illusion—God still determines the world in which choices are made.**

### Conclusion

Molinism **sounds like a perfect solution**, but it **introduces complex philosophical ideas that go beyond biblical revelation**. It is intellectually satisfying, but **is it truly necessary—or is it overcomplicating theology?**

---

# For Those Who Say, “I Don’t Like Any of These!”

After exploring **Lutheranism, Calvinism, Arminianism, and Molinism**, some may feel **unsatisfied with all of them**. Maybe none of these views seem to align with how you understand Scripture. Maybe you’re thinking, **“Can’t I just believe in God and not get tangled in all this theology?”**

If that’s you, **it’s worth exploring where your perspective actually falls**. Many who reject the above views often **default to something resembling Semi-Pelagianism**—a theological compromise that attempts to balance God’s grace and human effort. However, **this view has been historically condemned as heresy** for **undermining biblical teaching on sin and grace**.

Let’s take a look at **Semi-Pelagianism**, why it’s attractive, and ultimately, why it fails.

## Semi-Pelagianism
**The Intuitive But Heretical Middle Ground**

### What Semi-Pelagianism Teaches

Semi-Pelagianism tries to **strike a balance** between the **divine sovereignty of Augustinianism (which influenced Calvinism)** and the **free-will emphasis of Arminianism**. It teaches that:

### 1. Human Initiative Precedes Grace

- Unlike full **Pelagianism**, Semi-Pelagianism **affirms original sin** but claims it **only weakens** human nature rather than **fully corrupting it**.
- Humans **still retain the ability** to **take the first step toward God** without divine aid.
- Grace is **not what causes a person to seek God**; rather, grace **assists those who have already begun seeking** (contra **John 6:44**).

### 2. Grace Is Necessary, But Not the First Step

- Once a person **chooses to seek God**, then grace **helps them** in their journey toward salvation.
- This means salvation is **not purely by divine election** but a **cooperative effort** between God and man.

### 3. Faith Originates in the Human Will

- Faith is **not a sovereignly given gift** but a **human decision** that God **rewards with grace**.
- This makes faith **primarily a human effort** rather than the **result of God’s regeneration** (contra **Ephesians 2:8-9, Philippians 1:29**).

### 4. Resistible Grace & Uncertain Election

- Because **faith is a human decision**, grace **can be accepted or rejected** at any point.
- Unlike **Calvinism**, where the elect **will inevitably be saved**, in Semi-Pelagianism, a person **chooses salvation and can later lose it**.

### 5. Salvation Is a Gradual Process

- Rather than salvation being **fully determined by God’s decree (Calvinism)** or **fully secured through faith (Arminianism)**, Semi-Pelagianism views salvation as a **progressive process**.
- The human will is **slowly perfected by cooperation with grace**, rather than being **radically transformed by divine regeneration** (contra **Ezekiel 36:26-27**).

## Why Semi-Pelagianism Is Attractive

✔️ **It emphasizes human dignity** – Unlike **Calvinism**, which portrays salvation as **monergistic (God alone works it)**, Semi-Pelagianism allows **humans to contribute to their own salvation**.

✔️ **It maintains a sense of fairness** – If **grace only comes after a person seeks God**, then it **seems fair** because **people must “do their part” first**.

✔️ **It appears to preserve free will** – People can **genuinely accept or reject salvation** at different points in their lives.

However, **these strengths collapse under biblical scrutiny**, leading to **the historical rejection of Semi-Pelagianism as heretical**.

## Why Semi-Pelagianism Fails

Despite its appeal, **Semi-Pelagianism directly contradicts the Bible’s teaching on sin, grace, and salvation**.

### 1. The Bible Clearly Teaches That Fallen Humans Cannot Seek God on Their Own

- **Romans 3:10-12** – "There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is **no one who seeks God**."
- **John 6:44** – "No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him."
- **Ephesians 2:1** – "You were **dead** in your trespasses and sins."

🔹 **Semi-Pelagianism assumes humans are just "wounded," but Scripture describes them as spiritually dead**—incapable of seeking God without **grace first acting upon them**.

---

### 2. If Man Initiates Faith, Then Salvation Is No Longer By Grace Alone

- **Ephesians 2:8-9** – "For by **grace** you have been saved through faith, and **this is not your own doing**; it is **the gift of God**, not a result of works."
- **Philippians 1:29** – "For **it has been granted to you** that for the sake of Christ you should **not only believe in Him** but also suffer for His sake."

🔹 If faith **originates in the human will rather than in God's gift**, then **grace is no longer grace**—salvation becomes **a human achievement**.

---

### 3. If Salvation Depends on Human Initiative, Then God Is Not Fully in Control

- **Romans 9:16** – "So then **it depends not on human will or exertion**, but on God, who has mercy."
- **John 1:12-13** – "But to all who did receive Him, who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God, who were born, **not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God**."

🔹 If salvation **ultimately depends on man's decision**, then **God's sovereignty is limited**—He is not truly **Lord over salvation**.

---

### 4. The Church Historically Condemned Semi-Pelagianism as Heresy

At the **Council of Orange (529 AD)**, Semi-Pelagianism was **officially condemned** because it **compromised the biblical doctrine of grace**.

The Council affirmed:  
✅ **Grace must precede faith**—humans cannot seek God on their own.  
✅ **Even the desire to seek God is a result of grace.**  
✅ **Human effort cannot contribute to justification.**

🔹 **It was rightly condemned as heresy because it leads to a man-centered gospel.**

---

## Final Verdict on Semi-Pelagianism

### What It Gets Right

✔️ **Recognizes the need for grace** (unlike full Pelagianism).  
✔️ **Acknowledges human responsibility** in responding to God.

### Where It Falls Short

❌ **Undermines the necessity of grace in initiating faith**—which contradicts biblical teaching.  
❌ **Makes salvation partly dependent on human effort**—which contradicts Ephesians 2:8-9.  
❌ **Limits God's sovereignty**—which contradicts Romans 9:16.

### Conclusion: Semi-Pelagianism Is Intuitive, But Ultimately Unbiblical

While Semi-Pelagianism **feels natural**—after all, it makes sense that **we should contribute to our own salvation**—**it directly contradicts Scripture**. The Bible is **clear** that salvation is a **gift of God**, not something we **initiate by seeking Him first**.

🔹 If you find yourself **rejecting Lutheranism, Calvinism, Arminianism, and Molinism**, be careful **not to fall into Semi-Pelagianism**. It is **not a legitimate alternative**—it is a **false gospel** that was **rightly condemned by the Church**.


# Why I Am a Calvinist: Biblical Fidelity and Theological Consistency

After carefully examining the major theological perspectives—**Lutheranism, Calvinism, Arminianism, and Molinism**—I find myself compelled toward **Calvinism**, not because it is the easiest position, but because it is **the most consistent both biblically and logically**.

## Lutheranism: The Most Biblically Faithful, But Logically Unresolved

Lutheran theology is, in my view, **the most textually honest**. It presents **election, grace, and faith** exactly as they **appear in Scripture**, refusing to force a **man-made logical system** onto the biblical text.

✅ **It accepts paradox**—Scripture clearly teaches that:

- **God desires all to be saved** (**1 Timothy 2:4**)
- **Yet, not all are saved** (**Matthew 7:13-14**)
- **Salvation is purely God’s work** (**Ephesians 2:8-9**)
- **Yet, some reject it** (**John 3:18-19**)

🚨 **But here is the problem**: Lutheranism **refuses to take the next logical step**. It holds these tensions **without explanation**, leaving major unanswered questions:

- **How can God’s will be ultimately sovereign, yet some resist Him?**
- **If faith is a gift, why do some reject it while others accept?**
- **Why does God elect some but not others, yet still sincerely desire all to be saved?**

Lutheranism simply calls these **mysteries** and **leaves them unresolved**. While I appreciate its commitment to **letting Scripture speak for itself**, it **stops short of systematic clarity**, leaving the paradox **hanging in midair**.

## Calvinism: The Necessary Step Forward in Logic

Calvinism takes the foundation laid by **Lutheran monergism** and **logically carries it to its full conclusion**.

🔹 **If God alone saves, then faith itself must be determined by Him** (not just **offered**).  
🔹 **If salvation is fully dependent on God's will, then so is damnation** (even if in a passive sense).  
🔹 **If God’s grace is irresistible for the elect, then those who remain in unbelief do so because God has not given them saving grace.**

🚨 **Here’s where Calvinism resolves Lutheranism’s ambiguity:**

- Instead of saying **"God wants all to be saved, yet not all are saved"** and leaving it at that, Calvinism affirms:
    - **God’s saving will is particular**—He saves those whom He has **chosen before the foundation of the world** (**Ephesians 1:4-5**).
    - **God’s justice is revealed in both mercy and judgment**—He shows mercy to some and **passes over others**, letting them remain in their sin (**Romans 9:18-23**).
    - **Faith is a result of election, not the cause of it**—God doesn’t elect people **because they believe**; they **believe because they are elected** (**John 15:16, Romans 8:29-30**).

This does not eliminate **all mystery**, but it moves the **mystery** from **God’s actions** to **our limited understanding of His ways**.

## The Right Place for Mystery: Not in God's Actions, But in Our Understanding

**Here’s where Calvinism makes more sense than Lutheranism:**

- **Lutheranism** places **mystery in God’s actions**, making salvation seem **arbitrary and unresolved**.
- **Calvinism** places **mystery in our understanding of God’s ways**, but **not in His actions**.

Calvinism affirms that **God has an intentional decree**, even if we **do not fully grasp its justice**. Instead of saying, **“God’s will is paradoxical”**, Calvinism says, **“God’s will is perfect, but we do not have the full capacity to comprehend it.”**

I would **rather have mystery in my own limited understanding** than in **the very means by which God saves.**
