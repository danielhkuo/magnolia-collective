# The Doctrine of Original Sin and Its Exegetical Foundation in Spiritual Woundedness

---

The biblical narrative presents a coherent theological framework for understanding humanity’s inherent spiritual condition as one of profound woundedness resulting from the primordial disobedience of Adam. This thesis examines the grammatical, syntactical, and thematic evidence across key texts—Genesis 3, Psalm 51:5, and Romans 5:12–21 and 7:7–25—to demonstrate that original sin entails a corruption of human nature that transcends mere relational alienation or social conditioning. The exegesis reveals a state of spiritual disability marked by internal fragmentation, moral incapacity, and existential estrangement from God.

## The Protoevangelium of Fractured Communion: Genesis 3

The Genesis narrative of humanity’s fall (Genesis 3) establishes the ontological consequences of Adam’s disobedience through a deliberate interplay of covenantal language and cosmic disruption. The Hebrew verb *ʿāḇaḏ* (“to serve”), used in God’s command to “work and keep” the garden (2:15), frames Adam’s role as priestly steward[^1]. The serpent’s deception (*nāḥāš*, 3:1) introduces a distortion of this vocation, culminating in the woman’s reinterpretation of divine law: “God said, ‘You shall not eat of it, **nor shall you touch it**’” (3:3, emphasis added). This additive prohibition—absent from God’s original command (2:17)—exposes the epistemological rupture already unfolding in human consciousness[^2].

The aftermath of the transgression reveals a fourfold wounding:

1. **Relational Alienation**: The couple’s sudden awareness of nakedness (*ʿêrûmmîm*, 3:7) contrasts with their prior state of “unashamed” intimacy (2:25), signifying ruptured communion with God and one another. The Hebrew *bôš* (“to be ashamed”) carries cultic connotations of failed covenantal fidelity (cf. Jeremiah 2:26)[^3].
2. **Cognitive Disintegration**: Adam’s defensive response—“The woman **you gave** me…” (3:12)—demonstrates a fractured rationality that externalizes blame while implicating God Himself[^4].
3. **Volitional Bondage**: God’s pronouncement of enmity between the serpent’s offspring and the woman’s (3:15) introduces a cosmic conflict internalized in human nature, later developed in Paul’s “law of sin” (Romans 7:23)[^5].
4. **Existential Dislocation**: Expulsion from Eden (3:23–24) symbolizes humanity’s exile from divine life (*ḥayyîm*), with the cherubim’s flaming sword (*laḥat haḥereḇ*) barring access to the tree of life—a motif reprised in Israel’s temple symbolism[^6].

This narrative groundwork establishes sin as an invasive power corrupting humanity’s creational design rather than merely a series of discrete transgressions.

## The Ontology of Inborn Corruption: Psalm 51:5

David’s penitential confession in Psalm 51:5 (“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me”) provides critical lexical evidence for inherent spiritual woundedness. The Hebrew preposition *bə* (“in”) prefixed to *ʿāwōn* (“iniquity”) and *ḥeṭ* (“sin”) denotes envelopment within a state rather than incidental contact[^7]. The verbs *ḥāšaḇ* (“to conceive”) and *yālaḏ* (“to bring forth”), both in the imperfect tense, emphasize the continuous, unbroken transmission of this condition from conception[^8].

The pairing of *ʿāwōn* (moral perversion) and *ḥeṭ* (missing the mark) encapsulates the dual aspects of original sin: an inherited disposition toward evil (*habitus peccati*) and the objective guilt (*reatus*) arising from solidarity with Adam[^9]. David’s plea for a “clean heart” (*lēḇ ṭāhôr*, v. 10) and renewed “steadfast spirit” (*rûaḥ nāḵôn*, v. 12) presupposes an incapacity for self-remediation—a theme Paul later expands in Romans 7:18[^10].

## Cosmic Solidarity and the Reign of Death: Romans 5:12–21

Paul’s Adam-Christ typology in Romans 5:12–21 provides the most systematic exegetical foundation for original sin’s transmission. The crux lies in the Greek phrase *eph’ hō pantes hēmarton* (5:12c), traditionally rendered “because all sinned.” However, the preposition *eph’* with the dative *hō* more plausibly denotes covenantal representation—“**in whom** all sinned”[^11]. This aligns with Paul’s federal theology: just as Levi “paid tithes through Abraham” while “still in the loins of his father” (Hebrews 7:9–10), all humanity sinned *in Adam* as their covenantal head[^12].

The fourfold repetition of *polys mallon* (“much more,” 5:15, 17, 20) contrasts Adam’s trespass (*paraptōma*) with Christ’s righteousness (*dikaiōma*), emphasizing the unilateral nature of both condemnation and grace[^13]. Paul’s use of the aorist tense (*ebasileusan*, “reigned,” 5:14, 17) portrays death as an active, personified force exercising dominion (*basileuō*) over humanity—a power interiorized as spiritual death (Ephesians 2:1)[^14].

Key grammatical markers of inherent corruption include:

- The perfect passive participle *hoi touts hamartēsantos* (“those whose sins,” 5:16), indicating a settled state of sinfulness[^15].
- The instrumental dative *tō tou henos paraptōmati* (“by the one man’s trespass,” 5:18), establishing Adam’s act as the causal mechanism for universal condemnation[^16].

## The Existential Plight of Divided Agency: Romans 7:7–25

Paul’s autobiographical lament in Romans 7:7–25 anatomizes the psychological dimensions of original sin’s wounding. The repeated use of *ouk* (“not”) and *alla* (“but”) in verses 15–20 (“I do not do what I want…”) exposes the schism between the *nous* (“mind”) and *sarx* (“flesh”)[^17]. The present tense verbs (*prassō*, “practice,” v. 15; *katergazomai*, “produce,” v. 18) depict sin as an indwelling power (*ho oikōn en emoi hamartia*, “sin dwelling in me,” v. 20)[^18].

The articular noun *hē hamartia* (“**the** sin,” 7:13) personifies sin as a cosmic tyrant who “deceives” (*exēpatēsen*) and “kills” (*apokteinō*), recalling the serpent’s deception in Genesis 3:13[^19]. Paul’s admission of being “sold under sin” (*pepramenos hupo tēn hamartian*, 7:14) employs the perfect passive participle to signify a completed action with ongoing effects—a state of bondage inherited from Adam[^20].

## Countering Reductionist Alternatives

### Relational-Only Models
While sin undeniably fractures relationships (cf. Tillich’s “alienation”), the biblical data transcends mere interpersonal dysfunction. David’s inborn *ʿāwōn* (Psalm 51:5) and Paul’s “fleshly soldness” (Romans 7:14) posit an ontological corruption preceding social conditioning[^21]. Relational breakdown flows from—rather than causes—humanity’s wounded nature.

### Social Transmission Theories
The claim that sin spreads solely through cultural systems (cf. McKnight) conflicts with Paul’s cosmic-covenantal framework in Romans 5:12–21. Death’s reign “through one man” (5:17) operates independently of societal structures, as evidenced by infant mortality—a phenomenon inexplicable through purely socialized sin[^22].

### Non-Inherited Corruption Views
Attempts to limit original sin to environmental factors (e.g., “free will tendency”) founder on Psalm 51:5’s prenatal language and Romans 5:19’s *kathistēmi* (“constituted sinners”). The perfect passive *hestanmenoi* (“having been established”) in 5:2 underscores humanity’s fixed status in Adam prior to conscious choice[^23].

## Conclusion: The Wound Beneath the Wounds

The exegetical trajectory from Genesis to Romans reveals original sin as a metastatic condition distorting every human faculty: the mind’s blindness (2 Corinthians 4:4), the will’s bondage (John 8:34), and the affections’ disordering (Romans 1:26–27). This radical corruption—transmitted through natural generation yet transcending biological reductionism—constitutes humanity’s primal wound, rendering all subsequent sins symptomatic rather than causative.

The gospel’s power lies precisely in addressing this ontological rupture: Christ’s incarnation penetrates to the marrow of Adamic woundedness (Hebrews 4:12), effecting not merely forgiveness of sins but “the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5). Only through this recreative grace can the imago Dei—shattered in Eden—be restored to eschatological wholeness.
