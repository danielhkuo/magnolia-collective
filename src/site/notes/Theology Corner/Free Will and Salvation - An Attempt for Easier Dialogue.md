# Free Will and Salvation - An Attempt for Easier Dialogue
In discussions about free will and salvation, it has become increasingly common for specific (ignorant) individuals to claim, "___ side doesn't understand us! They simply cannot comprehend our position because they lack knowledge!" This often creates a rhetorical impasse, leaving genuine dialogue unachieved. To foster productive conversation, I find it necessary to clarify the various positions on this spectrum, as it will show that all individuals fall somewhere within this range rather than existing beyond it or outside of understanding.

The positions concerning free will and salvation form a gradient of beliefs. While this categorization may seem oversimplified, it is a helpful framework to reveal that one's stance exists on a continuum. This allows for meaningful comparison and conversation.

### Pelagianism
Augustine’s most influential legacy to Protestantism per se was his anti-Pelagian corpus (411–30). From the first of his many writings (*The Merits and Remission of Sins and Infant Baptism*, 411–12), he wove the Pelagians’ diverse emphases into a single *‘heresy’*. The controversy unfolded in three stages: against Celestius and Pelagius (411–18; *The Spirit and the Letter, Nature and Grace, The Perfection of Human Righteousness, The Grace of Christ and Original Sin, Epistle 194*); against Julian (419–30; *Marriage and Concupiscence, Against Two Letters of the Pelagians, Against Julian, Unfinished Work against Julian*); and against the misnamed semi-Pelagian monks of Africa and Gaul (427–30; *Grace and Free Will, Correction and Grace, Epistle 217, The Predestination of the Saints, The Gift of Perseverance*).

The long conflict witnessed Augustine’s construction of an evermore impregnable and forbidding theological fortress. Its building blocks included the following: an exalted view of the perfections of Adam and Eve, and hence of the disastrous consequences of the fall; the insistence that, because all sinned ‘in Adam’ (on which Augustine appealed to Ambrosiaster’s biological reading of Rom. 5:12), all are bound by the penalties for that *sin*—spiritual death, guilt, and the diseased disordering of human nature; *concupiscence*, from which no sexual acts of fallen humanity are free (even within Christian marriage), as the locus of transmission of original sin from parents to children; the impossibility of even ‘the beginning of faith’ without the gift of prevenient *grace* by whose power ‘the will is prepared’ to turn to God; the restriction of this grace to the baptized, so that infants dying unbaptized are condemned to hell, if perhaps to its milder reaches, and to the ‘fixed number’ of the elect, who receive it by God’s sovereign free mercy alone, with the rest of humankind left to their just deserts (Augustine rarely speaks of a divine *predestination to condemnation* parallel to predestination to salvation); the denial that God ‘will have all persons to be saved’, and the disjunction of election and baptism, for not all the baptized belong to the elect; the infallibility of the eternal redemption of the elect, in whom God’s grace works irresistibly (but not coercively) and who receive the ‘gift of perseverance’; and the conclusive appeal to the inscrutability of God’s judgments when mere human beings dared to question them.

The church in both East and West repudiated basic Pelagian beliefs, but did not canonize the full scope of Augustine’s refutation, either then or at the Second Council of Orange (529). Within Augustine’s own thinking, undoubted development is identifiable at important points, especially on the nature and transmission of original sin when compared with the voluntarist approach to sin of *Free Will* (391–95). Questions have often been raised (e.g. by Harnack) whether the institutional doctrine of the church and baptism in the anti-Donatist writings can survive the heavy anti-Pelagian stress on the *certus numerus* of the elect. Dogmatically, one might question the disjunction between the loving God who elects some and the just God who condemns the rest. But at its least controversial (e.g. in *The Spirit and the Letter*), Augustine’s theology provides an impressive exposition of the Pauline gospel.


### Semi-Pelagianism
Semi-Pelagianism was a largely monastic movement of reaction against Augustine’s developed anti-Pelagian teachings (and hence more fittingly called Semi-Augustinianism; ‘Semi-Pelagian’ is found no earlier than the sixteenth century). This ‘revolt of the monasteries’ began in Roman Africa in 427, evoking from Augustine *Grace and Free Will* and *Correction and Grace* in response to critics of his *Letter 194*. When he heard of monastic disaffection in South Gaul, where John Cassian’s teaching breathed an *Origenist optimism* (cf. P. Munz in JEH 11, 1960, pp. 1–22), Augustine wrote *The Predestination of the Saints* and *The Gift of Perseverance*. Controversy continued after his death (430), with his weightiest critic, Vincent of Lérins (see *Catholicity*), whose famous *Commonitory* implicitly faults his ‘non-catholic’ doctrine, and Prosper of Aquitaine (c. 390–c. 463) his tireless champion. Later, Faustus of Riez (c. 408–c. 490) and Fulgentius of Ruspe (468–533) represented the two positions.

Eventually, Bishop Caesarius of Arles (c. 470–542) convened the Second Council of Orange in 529, which condemned Semi-Pelagian (and Pelagian) doctrines and endorsed a qualified Augustinian theology. Its decrees, compiled by Caesarius partly from Prosper’s digest of Augustine, rejected *predestination to evil*, affirmed that with God’s *grace* we can fulfill his will, and were silent on such issues as irresistible grace, the fate of unbaptized infants, and the manner of transmission of original sin. The initial point of difference concerned ‘the beginning of *faith*’. Augustine’s critics insisted that this was an act of unaided human freedom, although grace instantly strengthened incipient faith. Augustine held that ‘the will is prepared by God’ by prevenient grace alone. The assault soon extended to the ‘fixed quota’ who were alone predestined to salvation and granted such grace, the abandonment of the rest of the ‘mass of perdition’ to just condemnation, the irresistibility of grace in the elect and their infallible *perseverance to the end*. Objection was also taken to Augustine’s denial that God ‘willed all people to be saved’, which even Prosper eventually abandoned.

This anti-Augustinianism arose in part out of a monastic spirituality anxious lest fatalism should encourage lethargy (monastic accidie) and make rebuke and exhortation, not to say prayer and evangelism, pointless. Although Augustine feared a recrudescence of Pelagianism proper, these ‘semi-Augustinians’ affirmed original sin and the necessity of grace for salvation, but sought a balanced antimony between grace and freedom, disliked the resort to God’s hidden counsels in election, and doubted whether a just predestination could avoid being based on foreknowledge.

The doctrinal issues opened up in these decades have reappeared regularly, especially in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries (see *Jesuit theology*) and in the ceaseless ‘Calvinist (see *Reformed theology*) vs. *Arminian*’ debate in modern evangelicalism.

### Arminianism
Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609) was a Dutch theologian educated at Leiden, Basel, and Geneva, at which latter place he studied under Beza. Upon returning to the Netherlands, he served as pastor in Amsterdam before becoming professor at Leiden in 1603. He questioned some basic assumptions of Reformed theology, arousing a bitter and vituperative controversy. Central to Arminius’ theology was his radical view of predestination. He attacked the speculative supralapsarianism of Beza on the grounds of its lack of Christocentricity, Christ being not the foundation of election but only the subordinate cause of an already foreordained salvation, resulting in a split between the decree of election and the decree concerning salvation through the incarnate Christ. This Christocentric concern led Arminius to invert the order of election and grace. For Reformed orthodoxy, the historical manifestation of God’s grace was dependent on election. For Arminius, election was subsequent to grace. God decrees to save all who repent, believe and persevere. Election is conditional on man’s response, dependent on God’s foreknowledge of his faith and perseverance. The possibility of a true believer totally or finally falling from grace and perishing is not denied. Consequently, there could be no assurance of ultimate salvation. Moreover, God gives sufficient grace so that man may believe on Christ if he will. His will is free. He can believe or he can resist God’s grace. Redemptive grace is universal, not particular, sufficient, not irresistible; man’s will is free, not bound, and cooperates with God’s grace rather than being vivified by it. Effectively, *Arminius was saying that God does not choose anyone, but instead foresees that some will choose him*. This was a position with Pelagian and Greek patristic roots.

Arminius’ views were developed by his followers in the five theses of the Remonstrant Articles (1610):  
(1) Predestination is conditional on a person’s response, being grounded in God’s foreknowledge;  
(2) Christ died for each and every person, but only believers are saved;  
(3) A person is unable to believe and needs the grace of God; but  
(4) This grace is resistible;  
(5) Whether all the regenerate will persevere requires further investigation.  

The resultant controversy assumed convulsive national importance, culminating in the Synod of Dort (1618–19), which condemned the Remonstrant Articles (see Dort, Canons of) and removed and exiled the Remonstrant ministers. To the Contra-Remonstrants, it appeared that the followers of Arminius had adopted a Semi-Pelagian view of grace, had destroyed the doctrine of assurance by questioning perseverance and, through their inversion of predestination, were introducing a conditional gospel which threatened the atonement and justification.

Some of the fears of the Contra-Remonstrants appear soon to have been fulfilled. Simon Episcopius (1583–1643), Remonstrant leader at Dort, a prominent figure behind the Remonstrant Articles and professor at Leiden, made further developments in his own theology. Reiterating a conditional doctrine of predestination, he held that only the Father had deity of himself, the Son and the Holy Spirit being subordinate not simply in terms of generation and spiration but also in essence (see Trinity). His stress was on Christ as exemplar, with doctrine subordinated to ethics.

The commitment to universal atonement (see Atonement, extent of) led followers of Arminius to oppose the penal substitutionary view of the atonement held by Reformed orthodoxy whereby Christ actually paid the penalty of all the sins of all his people and thus made effective atonement. For Arminianism, since Christ was held to have suffered for everyone, he could not have paid the penalty for their sins, since all are not saved. His death simply permits the Father to forgive all who repent and believe. It makes salvation possible, but does not intrinsically atone for anyone in particular. In fact, the atoning death of Christ was not essential for salvation by virtue of God’s own nature as both loving and righteous, but was rather the means God chose to save us for prudential administrative reasons. Hugo Grotius, an Arminian, was the first clearly to expound the governmental theory of the atonement.

Despite initial suppression in the Netherlands, Arminianism spread pervasively throughout the world, eventually permeating all Protestant churches. In particular, its growth was facilitated by the impact of John Wesley. Wesleyan Arminianism allowed that depravity was total, affecting every facet of man’s being, thus highlighting the need for grace. However, synergism (see Will) was retained, for the work of Christ was related to all men, delivering all from the guilt of Adam’s first sin and granting sufficient grace for repentance and faith, providing people ‘improve’ or appropriate it. Hence, the stress falls on human appropriation of grace. Additionally, the possibility of a true believer falling from grace was expressly accepted with the consequence that while one could have assurance of present salvation, there could be no present assurance of ultimate salvation. The leading Wesleyan theologian, Richard Watson (1781–1833), in his *Theological Institutes* (1823), did not even include election in his table of contents, regarding it as a temporal act subsequent to the administration of the means of salvation.

In recent years, Arminianism has become intermingled with Baptist and dispensationalist ideas, particularly in its contact with American fundamentalism. However, strictly speaking, it should be disentangled from such extraneous accretions so as to focus on its own intrinsic tenets: election based on foreknowledge, partial depravity, universal nonefficacious atonement, universal resistible grace, a voluntaristic view of faith, a Semi-Pelagian cooperation of a person with God’s grace, and the possibility of a true believer falling from grace with concomitant undermining of assurance.

### Molinism

#### Alfred J. Freddoso
Molinism, named after Luis de Molina, is a theological system for reconciling human freedom with God's grace and providence. Presupposing a strongly libertarian account of freedom, Molinists assert against their rivals that the grace whereby God cooperates with supernaturally salvific acts is not intrinsically efficacious. To preserve divine providence and foreknowledge, they then posit "middle knowledge", through which God knows, prior to his own free decrees, how any possible rational agent would freely act in any possible situation. Beyond this, they differ among themselves regarding the ground for middle knowledge and the doctrines of efficacious grace and predestination.
Molinism is an influential system within Catholic theology for reconciling human free choice with God's grace, providence, foreknowledge and predestination. Originating within the Society of Jesus in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, it encountered stiff opposition from Bañezian Thomists and from the self-styled Augustinian disciples of Michael Baius and Cornelius Jansen.

Molinism's three distinguishing marks are a strongly libertarian account of human freedom; the consequent conviction that the grace whereby God cooperates with supernaturally salvific free acts is not intrinsically efficacious; and the postulation of divine middle knowledge (scientia media), by which God knows, before any of his free decrees regarding creatures, how any possible rational being would freely act in any possible situation (see MOLINA, LUIS DE §§ 2-3).

Beyond this, Molinists disagree about three important issues. The first is the question of how God knows the "conditional future contingents" or "futuribilia" that constitute the objects of middle knowledge. Molinists cannot accept the Bañezian claim that God knows futuribilia by virtue of his freely decreeing their truth, since according to Molinism futuribilia have their truth prior to any free divine decree. Nor can Molinists claim that God knows futuribilia simply by virtue of comprehending all possible creatures, if "comprehending" a creature means just understanding all the metaphysical possibilities involving it. For such comprehension is insufficient for knowing how a possible creature would freely act - as opposed to how it could act - in any possible situation.

Molina himself claims that because God's cognitive power infinitely surpasses the natures of creatures, God is able to know those natures "in a more eminent way than that in which they are knowable in themselves." So God not only comprehends possible creatures but also "super-comprehends" them, as later Molinists put it, and in this way knows futuribilia involving them. One corollary, explicitly defended by Molina, is that God does not know futuribilia concerning his own free decrees, since his cognitive power does not infinitely surpass his own nature.

Other Molinists retort that no amount of insight into the natures of possible creatures can yield infallible knowledge of futuribilia, since such natures are exhausted by their metaphysical possibilities and do not include futuribilia. Instead, God has direct knowledge of futuribilia, unmediated by his knowledge of natures - and this simply because the futuribilia are true and hence intelligible to an infinite intellect. On this view there is no reason why God should not know futuribilia concerning his own free decrees - a result Molina takes to be incompatible with God's freedom.

The second dispute concerns the reason for the efficaciousness of the grace whereby God cooperates with supernaturally salvific acts of free choice. Suppose that in circumstances C, influenced by grace G, Peter freely elicits salvific act A. All Molinists agree that God places Peter in C with G knowing full well that Peter will freely elicit A; and they also agree that G is not intrinsically efficacious and hence does not causally predetermine A. However, there is strong disagreement about whether or not it is Peter's free consent alone that "extrinsically" renders G efficacious in C with respect to A.

One possible scenario is that God first resolves absolutely that Peter should freely elicit A in C and then, as it were, consults his middle knowledge to see just which particular graces would, if bestowed on Peter in C, obtain his free consent and thus issue in A. It follows that, given his antecedent resolution, God would have conferred some grace other than G if he had known by his middle knowledge that G would turn out to be "merely sufficient" with respect to A, i.e., that Peter would not freely consent to G in C. So G is rendered efficacious not only by Peter's free consent but also, and indeed more principally, by God's antecedent predetermination to confer a "congruous" grace that will guarantee Peter's acting well in C. This model, which brings Molinism more into line with Bañezianism, is known as Congruism and was worked out in detail by Robert Bellarmine and Francisco Suárez. In 1613 Congruism was mandated for all Jesuit theologians by the Father General Claude Aquiviva.

Another possible model, which seems to be Molina's own, is that God simply wills to put Peter into C with G, knowing that Peter will freely elicit A but not having absolutely resolved beforehand that Peter should freely elicit A. This model does not entail that if God had known that Peter would act badly in C with G, he would have conferred some grace other than G in order to guarantee A. Accordingly, it is Peter's free consent alone that renders G efficacious.

An analogous dispute arises over predestination, where the question concerns not one or another of Peter's acts, but his eternal salvation. Some Molinists, including Bellarmine and Suárez, agree with the Bañezians that God antecedently elects certain people to eternal glory and only then consults his middle knowledge to discover which graces will guarantee their salvation. Thus, in Peter's case, God would have chosen different graces if those he actually chose had been foreknown to be merely sufficient and not efficacious for Peter's salvation. Other Molinists, including Molina himself, vigorously reject any such antecedent absolute election of Peter to salvation. They insist instead that God simply chooses to create a world in which he infallibly foresees Peter's good use of the supernatural graces afforded him, and only then does he accept Peter among the elect in light of his free consent to those graces.

#### New Dictionary of Theology: Historical and Systematic
From "Jesuit Theology"
Among the ‘Rules for Thinking with the Church’, which Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, added to his Spiritual Exercises after encountering Protestantism at Paris, is the injunction ‘to praise both positive and scholastic theology’. ‘The positive doctors’ such as Augustine, Jerome and Gregory the Great promote the love and service of God, and ‘the scholastic doctors’ such as Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura and Peter Lombard ‘define and explain for our times the things necessary for eternal salvation, and refute and expose all errors and fallacies’. Ignatius’ Constitutions (finalized 1550–51) name Aristotle as the Jesuits’ authority in philosophy, and Thomas in scholastic doctrine. Their adoption of Thomas (see Thomism and Neo-Thomism), confirmed by the order’s Ratio Studiorum (Scheme of Study) in 1598, helped to make him Catholicism’s dominant theologian, displacing Peter Lombard. On certain topics Thomas’s opinions were declared to be not binding. In particular, the minority (Scotist) belief in Mary’s immaculate conception was espoused by the Jesuits, who subsequently proved ardent Mariologists.

The early generals of the order, especially Claudius Aquaviva (1543–1615), were concerned to ensure ‘solidity and uniformity of doctrine’ in its varied teaching activities. Although Ignatius had declared that ‘the scholastic doctors, being of more recent date, have a clearer understanding of the Holy Scripture and of the teachings of the positive and holy doctors’, the Jesuits’ polemical engagement with Protestantism and later Jansenism demanded increasing attention to the branches of ‘positive’ theology, especially the Bible, the Fathers and church history. The Dutchman Peter Canisius (1521–97) produced a widely used Catechism (Summa Doctrinae Christianae, 1554) and worked tirelessly against Protestantism in Germany and beyond, but the prolific and learned Bellarmine was the Jesuits’ supreme anti-Protestant controversialist. They had powerful centres of study at Louvain, Paris (Collège de Clermont), Cologne, Ingolstadt, Würzburg, Vienna, Prague, Alcala, Valladolid, Cracow and elsewhere, and their ranks included a remarkable number of weighty theologians and scholars, such as Francisco de Toledo (1532–96, scholastic), Jakob Gretser (1562–1625, historical-patristic controversialist), Peter de Fonseca (1528–99, ‘the Portuguese Aristotle’), and Leonhard Lessius (1554–1623, dogmatic and moral theologian).

Ignatius’ ‘Rules’ had warned against detracting from free will and good works by speaking too much of predestination and faith. From 1613, by a decree of Aquaviva, the Jesuits’ official teaching on grace became what was known as ‘Molinism’, from the Spaniard Luis de Molina (1535–1600). His Concordia (Harmony of Free Will with the Gifts of Grace, 1588) taught that the efficacy of grace lay not ‘intrinsically’ in the gift itself, but in the divinely foreknown co-operation with it of human free will. Efficacious grace, distinguished from sufficient grace, was defined as the grace to which a person consents. Francisco de Suárez (1548–1617), perhaps the greatest of Jesuit theologians, spoke of this as ‘congruism’. God bestows gratia congrua (i.e. grace ‘congruent’ with its profitable use by the recipients), which is foreknown by God’s special knowledge (scientia media). This obviously anti-Protestant position provoked a sharp dispute with the Dominicans, who were more faithful Thomists in following Augustine on the primacy of (irresistible) grace. A special congregation at Rome (De Auxiliis, 1597–1607) ended with toleration of both viewpoints, but subsequently the Jesuit one has more generally prevailed in the Roman church.

In the mid-seventeenth century the Jansenists accused the Jesuits of Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism. Jesuits were to the fore in the campaigns against Jansenism. The French patristic experts, Denis Petau (Petavius, 1583–1652) and Jean Garnier (1612–81), contested Jansenist interpretations of Augustine and the Pelagian movements. About a century earlier the teaching of Michel Baius of Louvain (1513–89) represented in effect an anticipation of Jansenism, and was condemned by Jesuits like Bellarmine and Lessius.

Jansenists also criticized the Jesuits’ zeal for papal supremacy, which went back to Ignatius himself. Two of his original associates, Diego Lainez (1512–65) and Alonzo Salmeron (1515–85), contributed effectively to the Council of Trent as (anti-conciliarist) ‘theologians of the pope’. Canisius was also active at Trent. Lainez insisted that bishops possessed their power of jurisdiction immediately from the pope, not from Christ. Later Jesuits were forceful in preparing for the definition of papal infallibility at the First Vatican Council (1870). They were essentially ultramontane and anti-Gallican theologians. Early Jesuits also accorded to the pope an ‘extraordinary and indirect’ power in the temporal realm. This belief was an element in the justification of lawful rebellion and tyrannicide advanced by Juan de Mariana (1536–1623), Bellarmine, Suárez and other Jesuits (along lines similar to contemporary Calvinists). Such political theology brought damaging accusations of sedition upon Jesuits in England and France in particular.

Jesuits also developed ascetic theology and spirituality, based on Ignatius’ Spiritual Exercises. In India and the Far East, Jesuit missionary pioneers like Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) and Robert de Nobili (1577–1656) were adventurous in the theology as well as the practice of mission (see Missiology). Jesuit moral theology has given too great a place to casuistry, and has earned the order a degree of notoriety. Its stress on ‘responsibility’ meant that one could not culpably sin without knowledge of what one was doing, and hence ‘good faith’ was always a valid excuse. Its ‘probabilism’, developed by Suárez and others and condemned by the Jansenists as ‘laxism’, in effect removed a moral obligation as soon as any serious doubt arose on informed and conscientious reflection. It was based on the principle that, in any doubtful case, it was lawful to follow a merely probable course of action contrary to the established norm, even if a more probable opinion favoured the norm itself. The system was subject to extended controversy in Catholic moral theology.

The golden age of the Society of Jesus was its first century, when it was a major factor in the reinvigoration of post-Reformation Catholicism (see Reformation, Catholic Counter-). Although a prey to controversies, and suppressed by Rome from 1773 to 1814, it remained a bastion of scholastic orthodoxy and fidelity to the papacy. As recently as 1916 the general of the order promulgated an instruction On Increasing Devotion to the Teaching of St Thomas in the Society. Although a few years earlier George Tyrrell (1861–1909) had been expelled from the order for his Catholic modernism, it was not until Teilhard de Chardin and the Second Vatican Council that the traditional image of Jesuit theology markedly changed. Jesuits remain at the centre of Catholic theological endeavour, with their own universities (e.g. the Gregorian at Rome) and numerous periodical publications, but their ranks have included some of Catholicism’s most controversial, as well as most important, modern theologians – Lonergan, Rahner, the Dutchman Piet Schoonenberg (1911–99), the Latin American liberation theologian Juan Luis Segundo (1925–96), Josef Jungmann (1889–1975), theologian of liturgy Henri de Lubac (1896–1991) and Jean Daniélou (1905–1974). With few exceptions (e.g. Jean Galot), Jesuit theologians can no longer be characterized straightforwardly as defenders of traditional orthodoxy.

### Augustinianism
The influence of Augustine has been so pervasive in Western Christianity that this survey can only be selective, concentrating chiefly on his (anti-Pelagian) ‘doctrines of grace’, to which Augustinianism as a theological system most commonly refers. Critical reactions against Augustine’s writings began in his lifetime with the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians. The outcome of these controversies was the canonizing of the heart of Augustine’s teaching in the fifth and sixth centuries. In 531 Pope Boniface II confirmed the decrees of the Second Council of Orange.

#### Legacy

Already Augustine enjoyed high esteem. Caesarius of Arles (d. 542) often seems little more than an adapter of Augustine, and other late Fathers, like Gregory the Great and Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636), treated him with deferential appreciation. Many digests and florilegia of his writings were produced, for example by Prosper of Aquitaine (d. 463), Eugippius, an abbot near Naples (d. 535), Bede (d. 735) and Florus of Lyons (d. c. 860). In the Carolingian renaissance, of which one inspiration was Augustine’s charter for Christian education and culture, On Christian Doctrine, the homiliaries of Paul Deacon (d. c. 800) and others, and the biblical commentaries and theological compilations of Alcuin (d. 804), Walafrid Strabo (d. 849), Rabanus Maurus (d. 856) and many more made heavy use of Augustine.

In the ninth century, Gottschalk was a controversial exponent of Augustinianism, in particular of double predestination and supralapsarianism. Among his opponents was the Neoplatonist Eriugena, who owed much to another side of Augustine, while among his supporters was Ratramnus, whose more spiritual view of the Eucharist was directed against the more ‘realist’ teaching of Paschasius Radbertus. Both were able to appeal to Augustine – a regular feature of later eucharistic disputes.

Both Anselm, the pioneer of the new scholastic approach to theology, and Bernard of Claivaux, one of its keenest critics, were indebted to Augustine. Augustine’s correlation of faith and reason appeared a ready-made justification for scholasticism, while Bernard’s spirituality and his teaching on grace and free will used him to quite different effect. Although scholasticism substituted Aristotle for Plato as the philosophical handmaid of theology, Augustine remained a dominant authority, not least in Peter Lombard and Thomas Aquinas, but the schoolmen increasingly inclined towards explanations of the relation between human free will and merit and divine grace that were in effect Semi-Pelagian.

The Franciscans in particular accorded a prominent place to Augustine in their theological study. Bonaventura, for example, was more of a Platonist than an Aristotelian, with a theory of illumination not unlike Augustine’s. Duns Scotus also picked up Augustinian motifs in his emphasis on God’s freedom and on will and love.

Augustine’s legacy was also acknowledged by the monastic movements (see Asceticism and monasticism) named after the Rule of Augustine. (The Rule became influential only in the eleventh century. The authenticity of its different versions is still disputed.) The Augustinian (Austin) Canons (‘canons regular’) were organized during the eleventh-century Gregorian reform, not in a single order but in separate ‘congregations’. Among these were the Victorines at Paris who constituted a leading school of Augustinian thought and spirituality. The Windesheim congregation in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries included the chief monastic representatives of the renewal movement known as the Devotio Moderna, whose ranks embraced Geert de Groote (1340–84), the founder of the Brethren of the Common Life, and Thomas à Kempis (see Spirituality). Erasmus, much influenced by those stirrings which fed into the Reformation at several points, was also an Augustinian Canon for a time.

The Augustinian Hermits or Friars were formed as an order in the thirteenth century. They were originally hermitic but soon became mendicant. Gregory of Rimini, a general of the order, was a thoroughly Augustinian theologian. Scholars debate the strength and significance of a renewed Augustinianism among the Augustinians in the pre-Reformation centuries. Later some of the Friars’ congregations became Reformed (i.e. strict ‘Observants’ of the Rule), including the German one which Luther joined at Erfurt in 1505. Its vicar-general was John Staupitz (1460/69–1529), Luther’s predecessor as professor of the Bible at Wittenberg. He was an uncompromising exponent of Augustine’s doctrine of election, with which he correlated a unilateral covenant whereby God appointed Christ to be the mediator of justification for the elect. He stressed the praise of God, fostered by humanity’s total dependence upon divine election and justification and by his assurance of the personal presence of the risen Christ. Staupitz’s influence on Luther was significant at a critical time, pointing him to God’s love in the cross, and interpreting his temptations as signs of God’s election. Karlstadt, Luther’s colleague and radical critic, dedicated his commentary on Augustine’s The Spirit and the Letter to Staupitz, although it was Luther who drove him to study Augustine afresh.

#### The Protestant Reformers

All the Magisterial Reformers sat at Augustine’s feet. They benefited from the Renaissance rediscovery of Christian antiquity. Several new editions of Augustine were printed, notably by Erasmus. The Reformation protest was directed against the prevalence in late medieval theology, for all its professed allegiance to Augustine, of one equivalent or other of Semi-Pelagianism. The nominalists, such as William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel, taught that doing what was within one’s natural power (facere quod in se est) merited the first infusion of grace from God (meritum de congruo). The Englishman Thomas Bradwardine strongly opposed Ockham’s Semi-Pelagianism with a somewhat extreme Augustinianism.

The Reformers highlighted different notes in Augustine. Calvin more thoroughly systematized his predestinarianism, while Luther was drawn to his grim portrayal of fallen humanity, probably going beyond Augustine’s account of the bondage of the will. On some elements, such as free will and original sin, other Reformers too favoured divergent formulations, but the kernel of Augustinianism was everywhere the heart of the Protestant gospel (see Reformation theology).

#### Roman Catholicism

But Rome could not concede the Protestants’ claims to be the true interpreters of Augustine. The two centuries after the Reformation were marked by controversies within Catholicism about the import of Augustine’s teachings. In undiluted form they repeatedly raised the spectre of crypto-Protestantism infiltrating the fold. Michel Baius (de Bay, 1513–89) was a Louvain theologian who claimed to have read the anti-Pelagian works seventy times! In 1567 a papal bull condemned many propositions from his writings. He undoubtedly espoused a sharper version of Augustinianism than counter-reform Catholicism could tolerate. This became evident in the new Jesuit Order’s official adoption of Molinist opinions which were in substance Semi-Pelagian. Dominicans who accused the Jesuits of Pelagianism were themselves accused of Calvinism. A papal ruling in 1607 allowed both main currents of teaching. Renewed controversy broke out a century later over Henri Noris (1631–1704), an Augustinian hermit and author of a learned history of Pelagianism and defence of Augustinianism against Molinism. The outcome was another authorization of different systems of thought within the church. In practice, the Jesuits’ Semi-Pelagian Molinism widely prevailed (see Jesuit theology).

1640 saw the publication of a posthumous work called Augustinus by Cornelius Jansen (1585–1638), a Dutchman who taught at Louvain. It sparked off a far more intense conflict, especially in France, where the Cistercian convent of Port-Royal, with two houses in Aulén, and near Paris, became the headquarters of Jansenism, under the lead of St Cyran (Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, 1581–1643, the abbot of St Cyran), Antoine Arnauld (1612–94) and his sister Jacqueline Angélique (1591–1661), the abbess of Port-Royal. Support came from Dominicans, Pascal and others sympathetic to a movement standing also for renewal of piety and devotion. The Jansenists’ main target was Jesuit theology, especially Molinism. In 1653 Pope Innocent X condemned five propositions, allegedly extracted from Jansen’s book, which affirmed that God’s commands cannot be fulfilled without grace; grace is irresistible; fallen man is free from coercion, not from necessity; the Semi-Pelagians’ error was denial of the irresistibility of grace; it is Semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died for all mankind. Jansenists contested this presentation of Jansen’s teaching, and dispute persisted. In 1713 a more comprehensive papal condemnation was given of a work by the French Oratorian, Pasquier Quesnel (1634–1719). Port-Royal was closed in 1709, but Dutch Jansenists formed an independent bishopric which has survived as part of the Old Catholic Church. This long controversy stimulated extensive study of Augustine and the Pelagian episodes. One fruit was the edition of his works, still the best complete one, by the Maurist Benedictines (1679–1700). Jansenist sympathies had been observed among the Maurists. Since the eighteenth century, Augustinian theology has been a less controversial subject for Catholics. Study of his works has continued to grow, with several periodicals and research centres, especially the Institut des Etudes Augustiniennes in Paris. In constructive theology, other aspects of his thought have increasingly kindled keener interest than the anti-Pelagian corpus. Protestantism Within Protestantism, the legacy of (anti-Pelagian) Augustinianism has been largely subsumed within the Lutheran and Reformed traditions. Platonic dualism has been held to be a major structural fault in Augustine’s teaching by theologians in the Barthian tradition, which also blames him for the Western preoccupation with anthropology rather than Christology. Reinhold Niebuhr’s ‘Christian realism’ was explicitly indebted to Augustine, and his Nature and Destiny of Man has been seen as a modern-day City of God. In much of modern theology across different traditions, Augustine’s creativity attracts continuing attention, from his teaching on the just war and his spiritual theology to his ideas on language and culture more generally. His emphasis on the relation between sexual disorder and human sinfulness is viewed as a still damaging legacy, while his role in the development of Western notions of the individual inner self is variously assessed.

#### New Dictionary of Theology: Historical and Systematic
Under "Reformed Theology"

The classic representative statements of Reformed theology are found in the catechisms and confessions of the Reformed churches: e.g. the French Confession (1559), the Scots Confession (1560), the Belgic Confession (1561), the Heidelberg Catechism (1563), the Second Helvetic Confession (1566), the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England (1562, 1571), the Canons of the Synod of Dort (1619), the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms (1647) and the Formula Consensus Helveticus (1675). On a secondary level are the writings of the leading representative theologians of those churches: e.g. Ulrich Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, Martin Bucer of Strasburg and Cambridge, John Calvin and Theodore Beza of Geneva, Peter Martyr Vermigli of Strasburg, Oxford and Zurich, together with later great synthesizers such as Amandus Polanus (1561–1610) and Francis Turretin (1623–1687).

##### Historical emergence
Reformed theology developed within sixteenth-century Protestantism in distinction from Lutheranism. Initial disagreement between Luther and Zwingli emerged on the Eucharist, coming to an open breach at the Colloquy of Marburg (1529). Luther's so-called consubstantiation was based on his radical, innovative view of the communicatio idiomatum ('interchange of properties' between Christ's divine and human natures; see Christology) as it found expression in the ubiquity of Christ's humanity. Other differences existed but were more of emphasis or else less divisive, e.g. Lutheranism tended to posit more discontinuity between law and gospel, to allow greater autonomy to the civil magistrate and to focus more narrowly on soteriology than did the Reformed. Yet agreement was immensely more extensive. Together with Rome and Constantinople, both held to the ecumenical dogmas on the Trinity and Christology. On the central affirmations of the Reformation (justification by faith, the denial of transubstantiation, the number of sacraments, the authority of Scripture) both were at one. Yet all attempts to achieve theological and ecclesiastical unity failed.

##### Principal characteristics
The centrality of God is a theme that pervades Reformed theology, which developed under the compelling demand of God's self-revelation in Scripture, its ultimate focus being on the Trinity, with a more immediate focus on Jesus Christ as mediator. In distinction from Lutheranism, in which Luther's personal struggles for forgiveness bequeathed a concentration on soteriology narrowly focused on justification, the Reformed attempted to bring the whole of reality under the sway of the supremacy of God. This can be seen as eminently biblical, while avoiding the perils of faddish 'emphases'. The dominance of the doctrine of God comes to expression in a number of ways:

(1) Human self-knowledge is attained only in the light of the knowledge of God. For Calvin, we are able to recognize who we are only when confronted by the supreme majesty and transcendent holiness of the living God as he makes himself known to us in his word by his Spirit. Thereby we are made cognizant of our sin and wretchedness, of the depravity that pervades our entire being. This Augustinianism represents in reality a high view of man, since we are seen as moral beings responsible to God, known only in the light of God. Our deep-rooted alienation is floodlit by the greatness of God. Our true identity is as the image of God.

(2) Salvation in its entirety is the work of God. Because of the pervasive impact of sin we stand under the condemnation of God, unable to change our status or condition. Hence, Reformed theology has consistently testified to the sole and sovereign activity of God in salvation. Its origin is God's eternal purpose, his sovereign election of his people in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), a choice made without regard to anything intrinsic in man. Correspondingly, although divergently nuanced, sovereign reprobation was consistently recognized. Therefore, Christ's purpose in incarnation and atonement was to save his people from their sins. His death was not intended to atone for every human being; for then either he would have failed, or the road would lead to universalism, uniformly rejected as unbiblical. Nor did the cross provisionally atone for all while intrinsically accomplishing nothing, leaving atonement in suspense, contingent upon believing appropriation of Christ. Rather, Christ made effective atonement for the sins of all his people (see Atonement, extent of). Similarly, the Holy Spirit draws us invincibly to Christ. Since we were dead in sin (Eph. 2:1) and unable because unwilling to trust Christ, faith (indeed, all Christian virtue) is entirely a gift of God. The Spirit not only brings us to Christ, but keeps us there. The whole process of sanctification and perseverance requires our strenuous effort in faith, but that effort itself is the Spirit's gift. Thus, Reformed theology maintained with vigour at Dort that none of the elect can finally fall away from grace so as to be lost.

Frequently, the mnemonic TULIP (Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance) is used to summarize the Canons of Dort and Reformed theology generally. However, this can present a truncated picture, an abridgment of the panoramic grandeur of the Reformed view of church and cosmos.

(3) The whole of personal and corporate life is to be subjected to God. Reformed theology has consistently sought to order the whole of life according to the requirements of God in Scripture. From its beginnings in Zurich, Strasburg and Geneva, strong efforts were made to model civic as well as ecclesiastical life in this way. Reformed theology has been linked with the rise of both capitalism and socialism, with the spread of education, literacy and science, besides revolution in France, the Netherlands, England, Scotland and the American colonies. Correspondingly, greater stress was laid on sanctification and the ongoing role of the law in the Christian life than in Lutheranism.

Consequently, Reformed theology has always sought to do justice to the corporate dimension of the gospel and, while increasingly influenced by individualism as time passed, nevertheless maintained this more effectively than other branches of Protestantism. Covenant theology exerted a strong impact in this direction within Reformed theology, since, although the covenant of grace was related to individual soteriology, the notion of the covenant of works made by God with Adam before the fall was increasingly applied, from 1600, to the civic and political responsibilities of nations to God on the basis of a permanent and universally binding law of creation.

Christocentricity. In early Reformed theology, exemplified by Calvin, Knox and Zanchius (1516–90), a consistent focus was evident on Christ as the ground of our knowledge of God, as the subject and object of election and, precisely because of the centrality of God, as the immediate focal centre of theology. Later, the impact of scholasticism, with its rigid logical deductivism, and covenant theology, with its preponderant use of the covenant concept (see below), led to the intrusion of other factors which then assumed a place of dominance. At times, attempts have been made to reassert a Christocentric trinitarianism, in extreme form by Karl Barth. A merit of such proposals has been to call attention to tendencies to depart from Reformed theology's roots.

Pluriformity. Reformed theology is not, nor has been, monolithic. It has possessed creative vitality sufficient to encompass diversity within an overall consensus. For instance, before Dort, differences existed on the question of limited atonement. Calvin was somewhat ambiguous, if not contradictory, on the matter, and may have leaned towards universal atonement. His successor Beza opposed the common formula (sufficient for all, efficient for the elect) on the grounds that it weakened the biblical stress on limited, or definite, atonement. Dort, in fact, fashioned a compromise agreement between the powerful British delegation's universalizing tendency and the majority's particularizing concern.

The development of covenant theology indicates diversity too. Begun with Zwingli, Oecolampadius and Bullinger, developed by Zacharius Ursinus and Kaspar Olevianus, the movement came to maturity with Robert Rollock (1555–99) and was further elaborated by Johannes Cocceius. While increasingly dominant in the seventeenth century, not all were covenant theologians in the sense of using the concept to structure their theology. Still more was this so before 1600. Differences existed on the nature of the covenant of grace: was it a unilateral and an unconditional imposition by God, or a bilateral pact with conditions to be fulfilled by man? Most early covenant theologians had one covenant, the covenant of grace. Later, the idea of the pre-fall covenant of works emerged. From 1648 a third, pre-temporal covenant was proposed. Each suggestion had its adherents. Additionally, diversity existed on questions of piety. Puritanism in old and new England was oriented towards praxis, sanctification and pastoralia, increasingly tending to anthropocentrism. Similar developments occurred in the Netherlands and Scotland. This represented a contrast with earlier Reformed theology and with the more scholastically oriented tradition. This pluriformity did not extend to Arminianism, which was proscribed by Dort for undermining the gratuitous theocentricity of salvation.

##### Calvin and Calvinism
Classical Reformed theology is often called 'Calvinism' due to the towering impact of John Calvin. However, this is not an entirely satisfactory term. First, owing to the above pluriformity Calvin neither could nor did impose his views on others. The autonomy of the various Reformed centres saw to that. For instance, his theology is not shaped by the covenant concept in the manner of later Reformed theology, yet after his death covenant theology became increasingly influential. Second, it is doubtful whether Calvin's distinctive theology, rooted in biblical exegesis, was properly grasped by many who came later. A recrudescence of Aristotelian scholasticism led to a greater reliance on reason and bred a markedly different theological climate, characterized by clarity of definition, rigorous deductivism, greater use of causal analysis and liberal employment of the syllogism. Calvin's more fluid biblicism went into eclipse. Consequently, many scholars posit a dichotomy between Calvin and the Calvinists. This can be overplayed, for, whatever the differences, the parties concerned saw themselves as colleagues not competitors. Despite his antipathy to Aristotle, Calvin did use Aristotelian causal analysis on occasion. However, the reintroduction of Aristotelian logic by Beza, Zanchius and Vermigli may well have encouraged the eventual ossification of Reformed theology by the late seventeenth century. The living biblical dynamic of earlier days, exemplified by a flood of biblical commentaries and trinitarian-grounded systematic treatises based on the Apostles' Creed (Calvin's Institutes was one), became straightjacketed in a rigid, logical, causal system. In fact, the ground was prepared for deism, since God became simply the First Cause behind an immanent causal chain. Despite this, there was still a major contribution to the renewal of Reformed theology in eighteenth-century North America by Jonathan Edwards.

##### Later developments
A revival of classic Reformed theology occurred in the nineteenth century in America, where the Princeton theology, spearheaded by Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge (1823–86) and B. B. Warfield, followed and adapted the scholastic Calvinism of Turretin. In Holland, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck also made a profound impact. Kuyper took his theology into public life, founding a university, a daily newspaper and a political party, eventually becoming prime minister.

In his massive reaction to liberalism, Karl Barth's debt to the Reformed theology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is obvious on almost every page of CD, seen in his welcome Christocentricity and his vigorous repudiation of anthropocentrism. However, it has been argued that he never entirely eradicated the existentialism so evident in his Romans commentary, and represented quite a different version of Reformed theology from that of the Reformation era and subsequent centuries.

The twentieth century witnessed major application of Reformed thinking to philosophy by e.g. Herman Dooyeweerd, and the development of a unitary theology interacting with modern physics by T. F. Torrance. Beyond that, Reformed theology shows an ongoing capacity for self-criticism and renewal which bodes well for the future, for, as Warfield argued, the future of Christianity is inseparable from the fortunes of the Reformed faith. Its concern for consistent theocentrism, its comprehensive worldview, and its at least implicit Christocentricity all exemplify its rigorous theological exploration of the gospel, its pursuit of 'faith seeking understanding', and its movement towards the integration of creation and redemption in Christ. Indeed, whenever prayer is offered, the church is engaging in Reformed theology, acknowledging what on other occasions its theology and praxis may sometimes deny.

## Hyper Calvinism
Hyper-Calvinism is a conservative form of traditional Reformed theology that holds to the five points of Calvinism as formulated by the Synod of Dort. In contrast with mainstream Calvinism, however, it denies the free offer of the gospel. Many Hyper-Calvinists also reject the historic Reformed doctrines of common grace and duty faith (i.e. that it is the duty of all who hear the gospel to savingly believe in Christ). They contend that free offers, common grace and duty faith are Arminian concepts and are incompatible with the Five Points. Their justification for their position is that God sincerely desires the salvation of only the elect, not all men. All Hyper-Calvinists have been supralapsarian, but not all supralapsarians have been Hyper-Calvinist (see Predestination). 

The movement is mainly associated with the Strict and Particular Baptists in England and the Protestant Reformed Church in America. It began in England around the year 1700. The first significant work was God's Operations of Grace, But No Offers of Grace (1707) by Joseph Hussey. The leading theologian has been John Gill, whose Body of Divinity, The Cause of God and Truth and other works continue to be reprinted. Other leaders include John Brine, William Huntington, William Gadsby, Joseph Charles Philpot, B. A. Ramsbottom and George Ella. The English movement was much curtailed by Andrew Fuller's The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation (1785) and the ministry of C. H. Spurgeon.

Herman Hoeksema (1886–1965) has been the leading American exponent, as in his Reformed Dogmatics (Grandville, 2 2004). Homer Hoeksema, David Engelsma and Herman Hanko have continued his tradition, which has been opposed by Cornelius Van Til, John Murray and others. The movement has always been a very small minority in the Reformed community.
