> “Paradox lies at the heart of every great doctrine of the faith. [Reformed Theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Christianity) affirms Both God’s unity and trinity, Christ’s divinity and humanity, God’s sovereignty and human responsibility. Believers are urged with all seriousness to work out their own salvation, and yet this salvation is already assured as a gift from the Father, and the Son, through the Spirit. The Kingdom of Christ is present now, inaugurated by Christ’s resurrection, and yet not fully consummated until his return. Ignoring these tensions (the irrationalist temptation) or resolving these tensions (the rationalist temptation) are always easy options. Living in the tension is more difficult; listening where God has spoken, but restraining our curiosity beyond his word.” —Michael Horton, For Calvinism

## Background

The Five Points of Calvinism states:  
	
[[Theology Corner/TULIP - The Five Points of Calvinism#Total Depravity The Human Condition\|Total Depravity (Total Inability)]] - Human nature is so fallen it cannot save itself and is by its fallen nature opposed to God  

[[Theology Corner/TULIP - The Five Points of Calvinism#Unconditional Election Loved Before Time\|Unconditional Election]] - God has chosen from eternity those he will bring to himself, not based on merit, virtue, or foreseen faith but rather, by mercy alone  

[[Theology Corner/TULIP - The Five Points of Calvinism#Limited Atonement Mission Accomplished\|Limited Atonement (Particular Redemption)]] - Christ died only for the elect, his death was certain and definite in its scope of what he wanted to accomplish

[[Theology Corner/TULIP - The Five Points of Calvinism#Effectual Calling Called\|Irresistible Grace (Effectual Calling)]] - The call onto salvation is effectually applied to those who are elect  and will save the ones God intends to save 

[[Theology Corner/TULIP - The Five Points of Calvinism#Perseverance of the Saints Kept\|Perseverance of the Saints]] -  It is impossible to fall away from the grace of God or to frustrate the will of God

The five points of Calvinism are not independent of other doctrines of Reformed Theology; rather, they are an outworking of *Sola Gratia*, one of the five Solas of the Reformation. Salvation by grace alone. The five points of Calvinism are often considered Reformed Theology as a whole, but in actuality, they are just the part of the whole that discusses salvation. There are Calvinistic Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, or Pentecostals without any of them being reformed (like John Piper or Matt Chandler, for example). It is also interesting to note that the five points of Calvinism, we called TULIP or the 5 points in general, were not considered 5 points until 1619, almost a hundred years after Calvin.

What occurred at this time that there was a debate over Calvin’s teachings in the Dutch Reformed churches over salvation between Calvin’s teaching and a group called the *Remonstrants* or, more commonly referred to as Arminians, after Jacobus Arminius, who was a student of Theodore Beza who was a student of Calvin himself. The Arminians published **The Five Articles of Remonstrance**, which were subject to review by the Dutch National Synod held in Dordrecht in 1618-1619. This hearing is commonly referred to as the **Synod of Dort**. 

  
The Five Articles of the Remonstrance stated that:  

**Article 3: Total Depravity** - Agrees with Calvin that man cannot save himself  

**Article 1: Conditional Election** - Election is conditional upon faith in Christ, and God elects salvation upon those He knows beforehand will have faith in him  
**Article 2: Unlimited Atonement** - Christ died for all men 

**Article 4: Resistible Grace** - Mankind has the free will to resist God’s grace

**Article 5: Conditional Perseverance of the Saints** - Perseverance is conditional on the believer remaining in Christ. 

  

(Note that Total Depravity was accepted by both Calvinists and Arminians/Remonstrants. A Denial of Total Depravity would be heretical - See [Pelagianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagianism) and [Semi-Pelagianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Pelagianism))  
  
The Synod met 154 times over six months and officially ruled that Arminius’ teachings were heretical; 200 Arminian pastors were removed from office, and others who refused to be silent on the matter were banished from the country. At the opening of the Synod, one of the Remonstrants wanted to begin by placing his objections to Calvinism as his opening statement, but the Synod reminded him that they were the ones on trial for departing from the Reformed faith, and so they were to justify their own position from scripture first. (Ie. They were the defendants and not the prosecutors) The Arminians refused to obey the procedure and withdrew from the Synod, where the proceedings continued with the board reviewing the doctrines of the Remonstrants without them. The judgment issued on these 5 points was called the Canons of Dort, and they became known as the Five Points of Calvinism. Turned into an acronym in the early 1900’s, the Five Points became commonly referred to as TULIP.  
  
## Analysis
  
We will now go into these 5 points more in depth and see what they teach and what they do not teach.

### Total Depravity: The Human Condition

> “Man as he is by nature is not as he was when God created him. A vast devastation has struck him. Nevertheless he is great in his ruins. Like a glorious cathedral after a bombing, sinful man still displays the grandeur which was his when he first stood on the earth as created in God’s image.” —Simon Blocker

Calvinism is often caricatured as making God the author of sin or turning humans into robots, but Calvinism actually begins with the affirmation that human nature has dignity and is “endowed with free will, the beauty of the body and soul, reason, and moral excellence. We are created in God’s image.” Calvin begins his [Institutes of the Christian Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Christian_Religion) with the words, “The mighty gifts with which we are endowed are hardly from ourselves; indeed, our very being is nothing but subsistence in the one God. Then, by these benefits shed like dew from heaven upon us, we are led as by rivulets to the spring itself.” According to the doctrine of Total Depravity, it is not that human nature was created with a flaw, but rather that the goodness of human nature was corrupted by the fall. The whole person, mind, soul, and body were created good, but the whole person fell. This is actually in direct opposition to some Platonist ideas that the mind and the soul are good, but the body is inherently sinful with sinful desires. But it takes a total fall to receive a total redemption. The fall wasn’t due to created failure but to the moral failure of willing and active agents.

The freedom of choice was given to humanity, so Adam and Eve had the capability of not disobeying and the power to attain eternal life. Adam had no sinful nature, but Adam was not incorruptible. He was not created with the inability to sin, but he was created without sin, and those are two different things. Just because he was created good without a sinful nature doesn’t mean he was created in a way where he could not corrupt himself through his own desires. The freedom of choice given to Adam and Eve was the freedom to obey or disobey. Adam and Eve were not created as machines, and they disobeyed out of their own volition.

 After the fall, the will of Adam and Eve became in bondage to sin. Their hearts were bound under a bent towards unbelief and sin, and the person became dead in their trespasses and sins. But this is not to say that their will was destroyed. Rather, every faculty of humanity was corrupted. Adam and Eve could have chosen immortal life, but they did not; it was by their own free will that they forfeited eternity for their own desires. Humanity (for the most part), since this time, still maintains the Imago Dei, the image of God, but it is distorted and disfigured but not removed. It is this very image of God in us that helps maintain reasonableness and logic, and it is from its general common grace and blessings.  
  
Another misconception of Total Depravity is what “Total” refers to. The totality of the corruption is not in regards to the intensity of the fallenness but its extensiveness. In other words, it’s not that we are so totally depraved that we are the worst we can ever be at all time, but rather that all of our faculties are depraved, and we are corrupt to the degree that we cannot heal ourselves without the grace of God. Our salvation must come external to ourselves. According to our fallen nature, freedom is freedom from compulsion but not from sin or misery. We still do that which we desire to do, but our desires are corrupt.
  
> “We are not free to choose whether or not we will be sinners, but in every sinful thought, desire, and action we are doing what we want to do. We are not compelled to sin. Just as God’s immunity to sin is derived from his own natural goodness rather than any external compulsion, so the reverse is true for sinners.” Calvin argues, fallen human beings are “not deprived of will, but of soundness of will.” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*

Free will is also a broad term that needs to be defined. Often, when we speak of free will, we think of libertarian "free will," i.e., the ability to choose anything and do anything. This definition of free will assumes that the will is not just free from both external compulsions but also from the mind, preferences, character, and heart of the person exercising it. However, even God does not have this kind of "free will." We all do that which is consistent with our nature. (God cannot sin, for example).
  
Before the fall, humanity possessed both the natural and moral ability to obey or disobey God. "Natural ability" refers to our capacity to make free decisions, without being forced. For example, no one compels me to raise my hand; I do it voluntarily. However, after the fall, we lost the moral ability to obey God. Though we still have the "tools" or faculties needed to love God and others, we lack the moral ability to desire these things without God's grace. As Jeremiah 17:9 declares, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?" Our nature always shapes our choices, and we always choose what we desire. The problem is that our nature is now corrupt.

This is in stark contrast to Christ, who, being fully human, had the natural ability to sin but, being fully God, lacked the moral ability to sin. Therefore, He was incapable of sinning, just as we will be in our future glorification.

Sin is not just an action but a state of being, a corruption of goodness. We are not sinners because we sin; rather, we sin because we are sinners. Satan cannot create; he can only corrupt. All sin distorts God's created order and goodness. This ties back to the doctrine of Total Depravity in TULIP, where both Arminians and Calvinists agree that humanity is entirely incapable of saving itself without God's grace. However, Calvin and other reformers noted that fallen humanity's natural inclination is to believe that some untainted goodness remains in us, even after the fall. We tend to think we aren't so fallen as to need righteousness from outside ourselves or salvation purely by God's grace. Many outside Christianity hold that humans have equal capacity for good and evil, believing that morality is merely a matter of the will, denying our fallen nature. Essentially, they view themselves as still in a pre-fall state, rather than living in post-fall reality.
What we need isn't a life coach to help us be our best selves. We need a Savior who will radically transform our nature, remove our sin, pay its penalty on our behalf, and grant us perfect righteousness—one foreign to us and received by grace alone.

### Unconditional Election: Loved Before Time

The doctrine of unconditional election is one of the most beautiful aspects of Reformed theology. It teaches that God’s love in electing and saving us is not based on anything we have done or will do. Before the world was created, God already loved us. There was never a moment when God did not love the Christian. Even though He knew we would deny Him, be His enemies, and hate Him, He still chose to love us. While we were still sinners, God the Father chose a bride for His Son from among all people, and by His Spirit, this bride would be united to the Son for all eternity.

Scripture clearly teaches election—the idea that some are saved and others are not. The question is whether election is conditional or unconditional. 

God has always had the freedom to choose some and not others. He chose Israel over other nations and Abraham over other men. As it is written, “The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for His treasured possession, out of all the peoples on the face of the earth” (Deut. 7:6). His choice of Israel was not based on merit, for they were the smallest of nations, nor on righteousness, for they were rebellious and sinful. Deuteronomy 9 reminds us, “It is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stubborn people” (Deut. 9:6-7). God chose Israel, fully aware of their disobedience. Even within the covenant community, He chose some and not others, such as Isaac over Ishmael and Jacob over Esau. These choices were made before they were born or had done anything good or bad. In Romans, Paul addresses the question, "Is this injustice? Is this unfair?" He responds that it is mercy for the guilty. The only injustice was toward Christ, who did not have to die but did. For us, who deserve death, it is mercy that we live.

It is not unjust for God to punish the guilty, nor is it unjust to pay someone else's debt. God is just because punishment falls either on His Son or on sinners. He is merciful in allowing some to have their debt paid, while others do not. No one deserves to have their debt paid—this is pure grace. And this grace extends beyond ethnic Israel, to people from every nation and tongue, to whomever God chooses. As Psalm 24:1 says, “The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein.” Unconditional election emphasizes God’s sovereignty. For those who believe they deserve a reward, fairness is their concern. But for those who understand they deserve condemnation, fairness is the last thing we want—we want mercy. 

The heart of the Christian says, “I am a sinner, have mercy on me.” But the heart of the non-believer says, “I have earned my reward, I deserve it.” The non-believer will receive what they believe they deserve, but it will not be Christ. 
  
> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us…. In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will.” (Ephesians 1:3–8, 11)

God does not act equally in saving some and condemning others. Some people mistakenly think that God actively condemns in the same way He actively saves—by giving people sinful natures to send them to hell. This misunderstanding portrays God as the author of sin, which Calvinism rejects. Calvinists affirm "double predestination," meaning God chooses some for salvation and passes over others, leaving them in their sin to face deserved punishment. This is different from "equal ultimacy," where God would actively cause people to sin just to condemn them. Instead, God's mercy transforms the desires of the saved, while His judgment remains on those who persist in sin.

Romans 9 supports God's freedom to choose: "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy... it depends not on human will or effort, but on God who has mercy" (Rom. 9:14-16). God can make "one vessel for honor and another for dishonor" from the same lump of guilty sinners. This lump represents corrupt humanity, not neutral people. No one is prevented from coming to God, but no one naturally desires to unless God changes their heart. The sinner chooses hell because of a hatred for God, while the saved sinner chooses Christ because of a new heart given by grace.

The fall was part of God's plan, but through His permissive, not active, will. God allowed Adam and Eve to disobey without making them sin. Likewise, He is active in softening hearts for salvation, but not in hardening hearts in the same way.

> “Jesus told his disciples, “You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide” (John 15:16). God chose Jacob and rejected of Esau, before they were born “and had done nothing either good or bad — in order that God’s purpose of election might continue” (Rom. 9:11). Indeed, “in this the love of God was made manifest among us … not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins We love because he first loved us” (1 Jn 4:9–10, 19).” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*

God’s foreknowledge is not merely knowledge of future events but a personal foreknowledge of people. He knew His chosen before the foundation of the world. Since God possesses perfect knowledge, He cannot learn something new or depend on anyone for knowledge. What God foreknows, He also preordains. The Arminian position, which suggests that God conditionally accepts people based on their faith or decisions made in time, implies that God depends on gained knowledge to make decisions about salvation. At its core, this aligns with [open theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_theism)—the belief that God learns the future—which is problematic. A God who learns and reacts is a God who depends, and such a God is not truly sovereign or worthy of worship. If God merely foreknows events without foreordaining them, it would mean that meaningless and purposeless events happen constantly, undermining any assurance of faith or purpose in life.

In contrast, the doctrine of Unconditional Election provides a solid foundation of hope. If salvation were based on what we earned, it could be lost when we fail. But since salvation is a gift with no conditions attached, it cannot be lost. This is the beauty of Unconditional Election: you don’t need to endlessly worry about whether you’ve repented enough or whether your faith is strong enough. ==Salvation is secure because it doesn’t depend on us but on Christ. Assurance is found by looking to Him, not ourselves.==

This raises the question: if election is unconditional, what role do we play in evangelism? Why preach the gospel if God has already chosen who will be saved? The answer lies in God’s chosen means. God has decreed that His plans will be fulfilled through the active participation of His people, including prayer, preaching, and gospel proclamation. Though God is the ultimate cause of salvation, He works through human agents to accomplish His will. There is a simultaneous operation of freedom: God's omnipotent freedom to accomplish His will and human freedom within our creaturely limits. These two types of freedom do not conflict. As creatures, our freedom operates within boundaries, just like a fish swimming in a tank—free to move as it pleases, but unable to change its environment. Similarly, human freedom is real, but it does not override God’s supreme will. God permits us to act according to our desires without coercing our every action.

God’s will can be understood in three ways: His _decretive will_ refers to what He ordains and will come to pass without fail; His _prescriptive will_ refers to His commands and desires for human obedience, which He allows humans to disobey; and His _permissive will_ refers to what He allows to happen generally. Though God ordains all things, He is not the author of sin. He is not the direct cause of every creature’s actions as if they were mere robots. Rather, sinners are bound by their own sin, and God does not actively prevent anyone from coming to Him. What God does in election is free the sinner to come to Him.

A common concern with this doctrine is the fear that someone we love may not be elect. However, Scripture assures us that God prevents no one from seeking Him. "His sheep hear His voice," and those who belong to Him will follow. Our role is to pray, trust in God’s goodness, and share the gospel. We do not assume to know who the elect are; instead, we share the gospel, and Christ calls His sheep through it. The gospel is the ordinary means of grace, but God can also work through extraordinary means. For example, God’s mercy extends to elect infants who die in infancy or those with severe mental disabilities who cannot respond to the gospel in the usual way. Since election depends on God’s mercy, not human effort or ability, even those who cannot actively respond to the gospel may still be elect. Ultimately, this doctrine affirms one essential truth: Salvation belongs to the Lord.

### Limited Atonement: Mission Accomplished

Limited Atonement addresses the question: *For whom did Christ die?*

While the term "Limited Atonement" fits neatly into the TULIP acronym, "Definite Atonement" or "Particular Redemption" are more precise terms. All Christians believe the atonement is limited, but they differ in how it is limited—either in extent or in nature.

Calvinists hold that the atonement is ==limited in its extent but unlimited in its nature and efficacy==—Christ’s death actually saves the elect. By contrast, Arminians believe the atonement is ==unlimited in extent but limited in its nature and efficacy==—Christ’s death makes salvation possible for all but does not actually save anyone until they choose to respond.

The atonement is necessary because sin incurs a legal penalty that must be satisfied. The penalty of sin is death, and Christ’s atonement is a form of penal substitution: "penal" because it satisfies the legal demands of God’s law, and "substitutionary" because Christ bears the penalty as a substitute in place of sinners. This is not about offended dignity; it is about fulfilling the demands of divine justice. Once the law is satisfied, reconciliation between God and the sinner can take place. This atonement is not a demonstration of God’s love alone—His love for the elect existed before the foundation of the world—it is a legal and forensic act. The love of God is not in conflict with the necessity of substitutionary atonement. All three persons of the Trinity are involved: the Father sends the Son, the Son willingly offers Himself as the payment, and the Spirit applies this work to the believer.

Moreover, the atonement involves "recapitulation" (or "re-headship"), where Christ reverses Adam’s role as the representative of mankind. Just as all humanity received death in Adam, all who are in Christ receive life. The atonement also signifies a conquest over Satan, representing victory over sin, death, and the powers of darkness. Ultimately, the atonement unites the sinner with Christ—Christ’s death satisfies the penalty for sin on the sinner's behalf. In this union, not only is the penalty for sin removed, but Christ's righteousness is also imputed to the believer.

In contrast, Arminian scholar Hugo Grotius proposed that God's nature did not demand absolute justice and satisfaction. He argued that Christ’s death made it possible for God to offer salvation on easier terms, suggesting the law was relaxed rather than fulfilled. However, since God’s law is a reflection of His moral nature, it cannot be relaxed or set aside. God’s righteous demands and holy will must be upheld, and death is not merely an example of His displeasure—it is the necessary consequence of sin under God’s law.

Now, regarding the extent of the atonement, there are three possible views:

1. Everyone will be saved (universalism).
2. Everyone is potentially savable (Arminianism).
3. Only the elect are saved (Calvinism).

Arminians believe that Christ’s death made salvation possible for all and that God grants grace, enabling people to cooperate with it to choose Christ. However, they also recognize that if Christ’s death _actually_ saves rather than merely making salvation possible, then Calvinism would be correct. Thus, they argue that Christ’s death only makes salvation possible, awaiting human cooperation—==a gift offered but not fully effective until the recipient accepts it.==

In contrast, Calvinism teaches that Christ’s death _actually_ redeemed all those He purposed to save, and the Holy Spirit applies this redemption in time to the elect. The difference is reflected in two common responses to the question of when one was saved: “2000 years ago, at the cross” vs. “When I asked Jesus into my heart.” While Christ’s atonement is of infinite worth and could have saved the entire world, He chose to effectively bear the sins of the elect alone. Here are the key arguments supporting this view:

1. **Christ’s death actually saves.** Scripture does not indicate that Christ came to make people merely "savable," nor does it teach that faith is what "activates" the atonement. If that were true, faith would become the condition and basis of salvation, shifting the focus from Christ to the believer’s effort. The finished work of Christ on the cross means that nothing is left for the sinner to complete by their own merit or decision. To suggest that Christ’s death only makes salvation possible would imply that His work is incomplete and that God is waiting, hoping for sinners to choose Him. This reduces God’s sovereignty and makes the Father’s sending of His Son a mere possibility, hinging on the uncertain response of human beings. (This is the idea behind the song _Reckless Love_—the notion of a God who begs for our choice.)
    
2. **The unity of the Trinity is upheld.** According to the covenant of redemption, the Father elects a certain number of people, gives them to the Son, and the Spirit completes this work by applying the benefits of redemption to them. Jesus assures that all whom the Father gives Him will come to Him, and none will be lost (John 6:37, 39). This is not a plan subject to change. The Father has determined who will be saved, and Christ’s atonement guarantees their salvation.
    
3. **The focus is on Christ, not the believer.** Without Definite Atonement, one cannot be sure that Christ actually died for them. It would be impossible to have full assurance of salvation because it would depend on whether we maintain our faith or avoid falling away. Without the certainty that Christ’s atonement is specifically for the elect, assurance would rest in the strength of our faith rather than in the completed work of Christ. The security of salvation lies in knowing that Christ’s death was definite, and thus, our hope is anchored in Him—not in ourselves.
  

#### Objections and Answers

**1. The New Testament teaches that Christ died for the world.**  
Objection: Doesn’t the Bible say that Christ died for the world?

**Answer:**  
When Scripture says that Christ died for the world, this is often understood in a context that contrasts Israel with the Gentiles, meaning that Christ died not just for the Jews but for people of all nations—Jews and Gentiles alike. The word "world" here refers to all kinds of people, from every tribe, tongue, and nation, rather than every individual without exception. Calvinists affirm that Christ's death is _sufficient_ for the entire world and beyond. Its value is infinite, and no one who comes to Christ for salvation will ever find that the offer of redemption was insufficient for them. In other words, anyone who comes to Christ will be saved (John 6:37). But the _application_ of Christ’s atonement is particular, extended only to the elect.

**2. Christ accomplished forgiveness for everyone, and now people are only condemned for their unbelief in Christ, not their sins.**  
Objection: Doesn’t unbelief, rather than sin, condemn people now that Christ has forgiven everyone?

**Answer:**  
John 3:18 makes it clear that unbelief is just one of many sins that condemn a person. It says, “Whoever does not believe is condemned already.” This doesn't mean that unbelief alone condemns people but that unbelief confirms their already condemned status as sinners. Christ’s atonement does not nullify the moral guilt of everyone, leaving unbelief as the only sin. Rather, Christ’s atonement applies only to the elect. The non-elect remain condemned for all their sins, unbelief included, and are judged for rejecting Christ because their sin nature inclines them away from God. The idea that unbelief alone condemns misses the fact that all sin continues to merit judgment.

**3. How can God justly condemn people if Christ didn’t die for them?**  
Objection: Isn't it unfair for God to condemn people if Christ didn’t die for them?

**Answer:**  
This objection assumes that fairness requires equal treatment for all, but God is not obligated to offer grace equally to everyone. The analogy of prisoners on death row helps illustrate this: If there are 100 prisoners, and the governor pardons 50 of them, he has acted with mercy toward those 50. He is not being unjust or unfair to the remaining 50 by leaving them to the punishment they deserve. The remaining prisoners do not have a claim on the governor’s mercy simply because others received it. In the same way, God is perfectly just in condemning sinners who remain in rebellion against Him. Grace is a gift, not a right. If God chooses to show mercy to some, He is not unjust for leaving others in their rebellion. God’s justice and mercy are both perfectly upheld: He shows mercy to whomever He wills (Romans 9:15-18), and He is just in punishing sin where it remains.

**4. The Bible says that God desires all people to be saved (2 Peter 3:9).**  
Objection: Doesn’t 2 Peter 3:9 show that God desires the salvation of every single person, contradicting the doctrine of limited atonement?

**Answer:**  
2 Peter 3:9 states, “The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.” On the surface, this seems to suggest that God desires the salvation of every single individual. However, a closer examination of the passage and its context reveals a more nuanced interpretation.

1. **Context: Addressing the Elect**  
In 2 Peter 3, ==Peter is speaking to believers, those who are described as the "beloved" or "elect" (2 Peter 1:1-4, 3:1)==. When Peter says that God is patient, "not wishing that any should perish," the "any" refers to *any of you*, meaning any of the elect. God is patient in delaying judgment so that all of His chosen people will come to repentance. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that God is sovereign in salvation and will bring all His elect to repentance and faith (John 6:37-39).

2. **Two Wills in God**  
The phrase "God desires all to be saved" must be understood in light of the distinction between God's *prescriptive will* and His *decretive will*. ==His prescriptive will refers to what He commands and desires, such as the call for all to repent and believe (Acts 17:30)==. His decretive will refers to His sovereign plan, by which He has ordained all that will come to pass, including who will be saved (Ephesians 1:11). While God commands all to repent, He has not decreed that all will do so. Thus, God’s desire for all to be saved in a general sense (prescriptive will) does not mean He has decreed the salvation of all (decretive will).

3. **God's Patience and Election**  
The patience of God mentioned in 2 Peter 3:9 is specific to the elect. God is delaying His final judgment to ensure that all whom He has chosen for salvation will be brought to repentance before Christ returns. This is in harmony with the teaching that God will not lose any of those whom He has predestined for salvation (John 6:39, Romans 8:29-30). Therefore, God’s desire here is not for the salvation of every individual without exception, but for the salvation of all those He has chosen.

4. **Consistency with the Rest of Scripture**  
Interpreting this verse as a desire for universal salvation would create a contradiction with other parts of Scripture that clearly indicate God’s sovereign choice in salvation (Romans 9:15-18, John 6:37-44). ==The idea that God desires all individuals to be saved but does not actually save all of them would also undermine His omnipotence and sovereignty.== If God truly desires something and decrees it, He brings it to pass. Therefore, God’s ultimate will (His decretive will) is that only the elect are saved.

The gift of God is not the ability to be saved. The gift of God is salvation. 


### Effectual Calling: Called

> “And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified” (Rom. 8:30). It is not without reason that the great Elizabethan Puritan William Perkins called Romans 8:30 the “golden chain” of salvation. Each link is forged by God’s love in Christ and bound to the other links by God’s immutable purpose in grace. If any one of these links depended ultimately on us, the whole chain would fall apart.” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*

We are chosen in Christ from all eternity, redeemed by Christ at the cross, but effectually called in time. The gift of God includes the very faith by which we receive Christ and all His benefits. The promise has already been made, and the only thing remaining is its actual bestowal, which is brought to us by the Spirit, who unites us to Christ. This effectual calling imparts to us everything Christ has secured for us, because it gives us Christ Himself. We make a distinction between the general call—the outward preaching of the gospel—and the effectual call, where the Spirit irresistibly draws the elect to Christ. In both cases, the Gospel is heard, but some hear it to their condemnation as they resist it, while others hear it to their salvation as they believe.

In the effectual calling of the Spirit, the sheep hear Christ’s voice and come to Him. This effectual call also breaks the bondage of the will to sin, creating in us a new heart and new desires aligned with God's will. Yet, even this crucial work of the Spirit is seen by Arminianism as conditioned on human cooperation:

> “According to H. Orton Wiley, “the Holy Spirit exerts His regenerating power only on certain conditions, that is, on the conditions of repentance and faith.” To Calvinist ears, this sounds like demanding that a blind person see before he or she has been healed of blindness. The glory of the new covenant is that God gives in the gospel what he demands in his law: both justification and the renewal of heart and life. Only because of God’s one-sided act of regeneration does anyone repent and believe. So even though Arminianism should not be equated with semi-Pelagianism, it does in fact deny that the new birth is a unilateral act of God’s grace. Every person is graciously enabled to believe, and the new birth is the consequence rather than the source of that decision.” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*


> It is sometimes believed because of “Irresistible Grace” that God takes the sinner kicking and screaming into salvation but what the Spirit does is not force anyone to be saved, it is the fact that the will is in bondage and prevents it from wanting God. The Spirit in freeing the will allows man to see God’s wonderfulness and then man finds the desire of his heart to be his and runs to it. There is no coercion. For those who are Christ’s they are effectually called and drawn to  the light. For those who are not Christ’s they fear the light and hide deeper in their darkness.  “While “irresistible grace” conjures the image of a physical cause-and-effect (i.e., coercion), “effectual calling” suggests an act of communicating. If I yell, “Fire!” in a crowded theater, the effect may certainly be powerful (namely, clearing the room), but it is not the same as forcing people to leave against their will. On one hand, Calvinists rightly insist that the Spirit’s regenerating work is more than moral persuasion, a gentle wooing that can be yielded to or resisted. On the other hand, they deny that this work is coercive.” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*

It is important to distinguish between effectual calling and conversion. The call is something we receive passively; it is the Spirit’s gift that imparts faith. But in conversion, we respond actively by choosing Christ. In effectual calling, we are given a new heart, and in conversion, we exercise that new heart by repenting of our old ways and turning to Christ in faith as our Savior. The effectual call is not something that can be resisted, but a declaration by God that takes effect. Those who reject the call are those who do not belong to Christ.

There is often a longing for a dramatic conversion story, such as Paul's experience on the road to Damascus. Some who have grown up in the faith feel as though their conversion lacks significance because it wasn't as radical or sudden. However, consider the beauty of never having had a time when you did not walk with and love Jesus. Whether one's conversion is gradual or sudden, the effectual calling and the work of the Spirit to change a sinner’s heart is a miraculous gift, no matter the circumstances. Every believer's story, whether dramatic or quiet, reflects the profound grace of God in salvation. The changing of a sinner’s heart is the miracle of the Spirit.

### Perseverance of the Saints: Kept

> “And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified” (Rom. 8:30). Paul does not say merely that some of those whom he predestined, called, and justified will also be glorified. In fact, he even puts glorification in the past tense as well, stressing its certainty for all of the elect. The apostle immediately adds: What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died — more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom. 8:31–39)” - Michael Horton, *For Calvinism*

**Perseverance of the Saints** is the inevitable outcome of the other points in the five doctrines of Calvinism. If salvation is entirely an act of God, then it follows that God will ensure our perseverance to the end. We are upheld by the promises of Christ.

“I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. The saying is trustworthy:  
If we have died with Him, we will also live with Him;  
If we endure, we will also reign with Him;  
If we deny Him, He also will deny us;  
If we are faithless, He remains faithful—for He cannot deny Himself.” (2 Tim. 2:10–13)

What about warnings of apostasy?

The New Testament community mirrors the Old Testament community. There exists both a visible church and an invisible church. Just as one could be outwardly a Jew but not one inwardly, so too one can be outwardly Christian but not inwardly regenerate. There is both a communal and an individual aspect to being a Christian.

All members of the visible church are Christians within the covenant of grace. Apostates, however, are not those who were never Christians, but rather Christian covenant breakers. On the other hand, the invisible church comprises those who are truly elect and saved, and who are both members of the visible church and participants in the covenant.

We must continually test ourselves to confirm our election and examine whether we are truly in the faith. This is done by affirming that we genuinely believe. However, it is not the strength of our faith that saves us but the object of our faith. Our hearts must align with our minds. Christ must be our personal Savior, even as He is the Savior of the church.

These doctrines though commonly known as Calvinism and TULIP are also known by another name: The Doctrines of Grace. They affirm the Grace of God in all of salvation apart from the works of man and are the truth of scripture for the church of Christ.
