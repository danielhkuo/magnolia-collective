Christians have long debated which Old Testament laws remain applicable today. Three major perspectives are generally presented:

### 1. **The Threefold Division (Moral, Ceremonial, Civil)**

This view categorizes Old Testament law into:
- **Moral Law** (e.g., Ten Commandments) These laws reflect God's unchanging character and remain binding for all people. For example, prohibitions against murder, theft, and adultery have always been morally wrong.
- **Ceremonial Law** (e.g., sacrifices, festivals, dietary laws): These pointed forward to Christ and were fulfilled by His death and resurrection (Col. 2:16-17; Heb. 8:13). Christians are no longer obligated to follow dietary restrictions or observe Jewish festivals as these served a temporary purpose, pointing to Jesus.
- **Judicial (Civil) Law** (e.g., property rules, penalties): These governed ancient Israel's society and are no longer directly applicable, though their principles of justice and fairness remain relevant today. There were some more in-depth descriptions here because Israel was a theocracy. I would say that these were meant to "sanctify" or set the Israelites apart.

This view finds support in historical confessions like the Westminster Confession of Faith.

### 2. "Only What is Repeated in the New Testament is Binding"

Another approach says Old Testament laws apply to Christians only if explicitly restated in the New Testament. This perspective argues that Christians should only follow commands reaffirmed by Jesus or the apostles.

For instance:
- Murder, theft, and adultery are explicitly repeated as sinful in the New Testament (e.g., Rom. 13:9–10).
- Dietary restrictions or Sabbath observance, not repeated in a binding manner, are not required.

### 3. All Laws as a Mirror Pointing to Christ

This perspective, common among Lutherans, views all Old Testament laws primarily as revealing our sinfulness and driving us to rely on Christ's righteousness (Rom. 3:20, Gal. 3:24).

According to this view:
- No law is directly binding simply because it's in the Old Testament. Instead, all law exposes our need for grace.
- However, Christians still uphold moral teachings like the Ten Commandments, not out of obligation, but out of grateful response to Christ’s forgiveness.

This emphasizes that obedience is a thankful response, not a method of salvation.

Despite differences, all orthodox Christians affirm that **God's moral character never changes** (Mal. 3:6). Thus, moral laws reflecting His holiness remain relevant. In addition, **Christ fulfills the Law** (Matt. 5:17–18). Laws fulfilled by Christ (e.g., sacrifices, dietary laws) are no longer required, as their purpose was fully achieved in Him. Finally, **The Spirit guides believers** (Heb. 8:10; Rom. 8:4). Christians live obediently not by rigid law-following but by the Holy Spirit transforming their hearts.

Personally, I lean towards the threefold distinction common in the Reformed tradition, emphasizing that moral laws reflect God's eternal character and thus apply today, while ceremonial and civil laws were temporary, pointing forward to Jesus and fulfilled in Him. However, the Lutheran emphasis on law as a mirror pointing to our need for Christ reminds me that our obedience is always a grateful response to grace, never a means of earning salvation.

Ultimately, Christians seek to live holy lives, not out of obligation, but out of love and gratitude toward the God who fulfilled the law perfectly on our behalf through Jesus Christ.
